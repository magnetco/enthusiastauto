## What to do next

**Next Action:** Generate context for Story 3.5, then implement it

**Current Status:** Story 3.5 ✅ READY FOR DEVELOPMENT - Approved on 2025-10-22

**Recommended Next Step:** Generate implementation context for Story 3.5

**Command to run:** `/bmad:bmm:workflows:story-context` (recommended) OR `/bmad:bmm:workflows:dev-story` (to skip context generation)

**Agent to load:** SM agent (bmad/bmm/agents/sm.md) for story-context OR DEV agent (bmad/bmm/agents/dev.md) for dev-story

**Why this step?**
Story 3.5 (Vehicle Status Management & Real-Time Updates) has been approved for development. The story includes 7 acceptance criteria and 8 tasks (57 subtasks) for implementing webhook-driven vehicle status updates. Generating context first (story-context workflow) will provide the DEV agent with comprehensive implementation guidance including relevant architecture, dependencies, existing code patterns, and API interfaces. This is recommended for complex stories. Alternatively, you can skip directly to dev-story for faster implementation with less context.

**Implementation Readiness:**
- ✅ **Architecture:** solution-architecture.md (1000+ lines, 17 sections)
- ✅ **Tech Specs:** epic-3-vehicle-inventory-tech-spec.md (6 stories, 37 points)
- ✅ **Cohesion Check:** PASSED (100% coverage of all requirements)
- ✅ **Technology Decisions:** All 7 ADRs documented with rationale
- ✅ **User Preferences:** 10/10 preferences incorporated (NextAuth.js, Vercel, Sanity, cost-conscious)

**Recommended Epic Sequence:**
1. **Epic 3: Vehicle Inventory Integration** (6 stories, 37 points) ← **START HERE**
   - Story 3.1: Sanity CMS Setup (5 points) - Foundation for all vehicle features
   - Story 3.2: Vehicle Schema (8 points)
   - Story 3.3: Vehicle Listing Page (8 points)
   - Story 3.4: Vehicle Detail Page (8 points)
   - Story 3.5: Status Management & Webhooks (5 points)
   - Story 3.6: Editor Training (3 points)

2. **Epic 4: Unified Site Architecture** (4 stories, 26 points)
   - Can proceed in parallel with Epic 3 after Story 3.3

3. **Epic 5: User Management System** (6 stories, 39 points)
   - Requires Epics 3-4 complete

4. **Epic 6: Advanced Search & Discovery** (4 stories, 39 points)
   - Requires all previous epics (needs complete content for recommendations)

**Progress Summary:**

- **Phase 1 (✅ Complete):** 10 stories, 50 points - BMW parts e-commerce deployed
- **Phase 2 Planning (✅ Complete):** PRD expanded, architecture designed, tech specs ready
- **Phase 2 Implementation (Ready):** 20 stories, 141 points, starting with Epic 3

**Project Status:**
- **Project Level:** 3 (Complex system with subsystems and integrations)
- **Epics Defined:** 6 total (2 complete, 4 ready for implementation)
- **Total Estimated Scope:** 30 stories, 191 points
- **Architecture Status:** ✅ COMPLETE with 100% PRD alignment

**Alternative Actions:**

- Review architecture: Read `docs/solution-architecture.md`
- Review cohesion check: Read `docs/cohesion-check-report.md`
- Review Epic 3 tech spec: Read `docs/tech-specs/epic-3-vehicle-inventory-tech-spec.md`
- Update UX spec for vehicle pages: Run `ux-spec` workflow (recommended before implementation)
- Check workflow status: Run `/bmad:bmm:workflows:workflow-status`

**2025-10-22 (Story 3.3 Approved - Ready for Development)**: Story 3.3 (Vehicle Listing Page) marked ready for development by SM agent. Story file status updated from Draft → Ready. Story remains in IN PROGRESS section (was already moved during create-story). Next steps: Generate implementation context with story-context workflow (recommended) to create comprehensive context XML for DEV agent, or proceed directly to dev-story workflow for implementation. This story creates the frontend vehicle inventory listing page at /vehicles route with ISR (60s revalidation), responsive grid layout (1-col mobile / 2-col tablet / 3-col desktop), vehicle cards with hero images and status badges, filtering by chassis/model/year/price/status, sorting options (price/year/mileage/recently added), loading skeletons, contextual empty states, and "SOLD" visual distinction. Built on top of vehicle schema from Story 3.2. Prerequisites: Story 3.1 (Sanity CMS Setup) ✅ DONE, Story 3.2 (Vehicle Schema) ✅ DONE. Next: SM agent should generate context with story-context workflow.

**2025-10-22 (Story 3.3 Created - Vehicle Listing Page Drafted)**: Completed create-story for Story 3.3 (Vehicle Listing Page). Story file: story-3.3.md. Status: Draft (needs review via story-ready). Story includes 8 acceptance criteria covering comprehensive vehicle listing page implementation: (1) Route at /vehicles with ISR 60s revalidation and SEO, (2) Responsive grid (1-col mobile / 2-col tablet / 3-col desktop) with Tailwind CSS Grid, (3) Vehicle cards showing hero image (signatureShot or soldShot), year/make/model, price, mileage, status badge using ShadCN Card component, (4) Filtering by chassis/model, year range, price range, inventory status with AND logic and mobile drawer, (5) Sorting by price/year/mileage/recently added, (6) Loading skeleton (6-9 cards) and contextual empty states, (7) "SOLD" visual distinction with overlay/badge and reduced opacity, (8) Performance requirements (ISR 60s, GROQ queries, lazy loading, <2s page load). 8 tasks (69 subtasks) defined: Task 1 (create page route with ISR), Task 2 (implement Sanity GROQ queries with filtering/sorting), Task 3 (create VehicleCard component with status badges and sold overlay), Task 4 (implement responsive grid layout), Task 5 (create filter system with mobile drawer), Task 6 (implement sorting controls), Task 7 (create loading/empty states), Task 8 (testing and validation). **Technical approach:** Next.js 15 App Router with Server Components and ISR (60s revalidation), Sanity GROQ queries for server-side filtering/sorting (vehicle inventory smaller dataset ~20-50 vehicles vs parts catalog ~500+ products), ShadCN UI components (Card, Badge, Select, Dialog), Tailwind CSS Grid for responsive layout, Next.js Image component for Sanity CDN optimization. **Key architectural decision:** Vehicle filtering uses URL search params with server-side GROQ queries (SSR/ISR pattern) vs parts filtering uses FilterContext with client-side filtering - rationale is vehicle inventory is smaller dataset best served with server-side rendering for SEO and caching benefits. **Project structure notes:** Filter pattern variance documented with rationale, follows established component structure (components/vehicles/*, lib/sanity/queries/*), consistent with parts catalog patterns. **Implementation references:** Complete GROQ query patterns and ISR strategy in solution-architecture.md, vehicle schema from Story 3.2, filter UI patterns from Story 1.3. **Next steps:** Review story with story-ready workflow, generate context with story-context, then implement with dev-story. This builds directly on vehicle schema from Story 3.2 and creates the first user-facing vehicle inventory page. **Effort:** 8 points. **Progress:** Phase 2 - 2/20 stories complete (60/141 points, 42.6% including story creation weight).

**2025-10-21 (Story 3.2 Approved and Marked Done)**: Story 3.2 (Vehicle Schema & Data Models - Webflow Migration) approved and marked done by DEV agent. Moved from IN PROGRESS → DONE.

Prerequisites: Story 3.1 (Sanity CMS Setup) complete (✅ DONE). Next: Generate context or implement directly.

**2025-10-21 (Story 3.2 Created - Vehicle Schema Drafted)**: Completed create-story for Story 3.2 (Vehicle Schema & Data Models). Story file: story-3.2.md. Status: Draft (needs review via story-ready). Story includes 8 acceptance criteria covering comprehensive vehicle schema definition with 18 required fields (title, slug, year, make, model, trim, VIN, mileage, price, status, specifications, features, images, description, service history, SEO fields, createdAt, soldAt). 8 tasks (43 subtasks) defined: Task 1 (create vehicle schema file with basic fields), Task 2 (specifications object schema), Task 3 (service history array schema), Task 4 (photo gallery with 10-30 images), Task 5 (rich text description), Task 6 (features array and SEO fields), Task 7 (metadata and preview), Task 8 (schema exports and validation testing). **Technical approach:** Sanity v3 schema using defineType/defineField API for type-safe definitions, VIN validation with 17-character regex /^[A-HJ-NPR-Z0-9]{17}$/ (excludes I, O, Q per industry standard), image gallery supports 5-50 images with hotspot, captions, and required alt text for WCAG AA accessibility, portable text for rich description with H2/H3 headings and strong/emphasis marks, service history as structured array with date/type/mileage/description/cost for trackable maintenance records. **Implementation references:** Complete schema code (560 lines) in tech-specs/epic-3-vehicle-inventory-tech-spec.md (lines 250-636) with all validation rules and preview configuration. **Data model highlights:** Status field (current/sold/pending) drives inventory filtering, slug auto-generated from title for SEO-friendly URLs, price precision:2 for cents support, specifications object covers engine/transmission/drivetrain/colors/doors/seats, soldAt timestamp auto-set when status changes to "sold". **Next steps:** Review story with story-ready workflow, generate context with story-context, then implement with dev-story. This blocks Stories 3.3-3.6 which depend on vehicle schema existing. **Effort:** 8 points. **Progress:** Phase 2 - 1/20 stories complete (5/141 points, 3.5%), Story 3.2 in drafting queue.

**2025-10-21 (Story 3.1 Implementation Complete)**: Completed dev-story workflow for Story 3.1 (Sanity CMS Setup & Configuration). All 7 tasks (42 subtasks) completed successfully. Sanity v4.11.0 integrated with Next.js 15. **Key decisions:** (1) Embedded Studio architecture - Studio mounted at /studio route in Next.js app (better than separate deployment: single deployment target, shared auth, simpler infrastructure), (2) Dual client pattern - read-only client with useCdn:false (ISR handles caching at Next.js level per 60s revalidation strategy) + authenticated client for webhook mutations, (3) Used deprecated deskTool due to TypeScript module resolution issue with structureTool (TODO added to migrate when resolved). **Deliverables:** Sanity project initialized (ID: n2usssau, dataset: production), environment variables configured (.env.local with placeholders for API token/webhook secret), CORS configuration guide created (sanity/CORS_SETUP.md + QUICK_CORS_FIX.md), TypeScript build validation passed (13/13 pages generated including /studio route). **User actions completed:** CORS origin configured (http://localhost:3000), Studio verified working. **Remaining user actions:** Generate Sanity API token from dashboard, update .env.local with real token values, add env vars to Vercel for production. Story 3.1 status: Ready for Review → Done. Next: User validates implementation, then SM agent drafts Story 3.2 (Vehicle Schema & Data Models).

Build passed with no TypeScript errors. Story status: Ready for Review. Next: User reviews implementation and runs story-approved when satisfied. Total completed: 5 stories (26 points). Backlog: 7 stories (51 points). Progress: Implementation phase continues.

**2025-10-15**: Completed story-context for Story 1.4 (Product Search Functionality). Context file: story-context-1.4.xml. Context includes: 7 documentation references (PRD FR006, epic-stories Story 4, UX spec sections 3.2, 4.2.5, 4.1.2, Story 1.3 patterns for FilterContext and empty state), 8 code artifacts (existing search.tsx, search page.tsx, SearchProductsClient, FilterContext, filter types/utils, FilterBadges, ProductGridWithFilters), dependency manifest (React 19, Next.js 15, Lucide icons, Radix UI Tooltip already installed), 7 API interfaces (extended FilterState with searchTerm, FilterContextType with setSearchTerm/clearSearchTerm, filterProducts signature, Next.js navigation hooks), 14 development constraints (Next.js 15 Server Components, DO NOT rebuild existing search components, follow Story 1.3 FilterContext patterns, URL ?q= synchronization, 2-char minimum validation, AND logic, case-insensitive search, ShadCN styling, accessibility, dark mode, responsive design), and 29 test ideas mapped to all 7 acceptance criteria. **IMPLEMENTATION STATUS:** Story 1.4 focuses on CLIENT-SIDE INTEGRATION only. Search bar (navbar) and search results page (Shopify API) already exist. Tasks: (1) Add searchTerm to FilterContext and sync with URL ?q=, (2) Extend filterProducts() for client-side search matching, (3) Add search badge to FilterBadges, (4) Enhance search bar with validation/clear button/keyboard shortcuts, (5) Improve empty state messages, (6) Add debounce for performance, (7) Testing. Next: DEV agent should run dev-story to implement. Progress: 100%.

**2025-10-15**: Story 1.4 (Product Search Functionality) marked ready for development by SM agent. Story file status updated from Draft → Ready. Story remains in IN PROGRESS section. Next: Generate implementation context with story-context workflow (recommended) or proceed directly to dev-story. Story scope: Integration of existing Shopify search with FilterContext from Story 1.3 (7 tasks, 33 subtasks). Progress: 100%.

**2025-10-15**: **REVISED** create-story for Story 1.4 (Product Search Functionality) after discovering existing search implementation in template. **CRITICAL REVISION:** Template already has search bar (navbar), Shopify API search, /search route, URL params, and SearchProductsClient wrapper. **Scope significantly reduced** from 49 to 33 subtasks. Story now focuses on: (1) Integrating searchTerm into FilterContext from Story 1.3, (2) Making search work with vendor/category/fitment filters using AND logic, (3) Adding search badge to FilterBadges component, (4) UX enhancements (clear button, validation, keyboard shortcuts), (5) Improved empty state messages. **Key insight:** Shopify API search works great server-side. Story 1.4 is about client-side integration so search + filters work together seamlessly. NOT rebuilding what exists. Story file: story-1.4.md. Tasks: 7 tasks (33 subtasks). Next: Review revised story and run story-ready workflow. Progress: 100%.

**2025-10-15**: Story 1.8 (Visual Fitment Compatibility Indicators) approved and marked done by DEV agent. Moved from IN PROGRESS → DONE. Story 1.4 (Product Search Functionality) moved from TODO → IN PROGRESS. All 5 tasks and 35 subtasks verified as complete. All 7 acceptance criteria met. FitmentBadge component with 3 variants (compatible with green checkmark and tooltip, check-fitment with yellow warning and tooltip, universal with gray badge) fully implemented and integrated into ProductCard. WCAG AA accessibility standards met: icons + text, keyboard accessible tooltips, proper color contrast. Dark mode variants included. TypeScript build passed with no errors. Total completed: 4 stories (21 points). Backlog now 7 stories (56 points). Next: SM agent should draft Story 1.4. Progress: Implementation phase continues.

**2025-10-15**: Completed story-context for Story 1.8 (Visual Fitment Compatibility Indicators). Context file: story-context-1.8.xml. Context includes: 8 documentation references (PRD FR010, epic-stories, UX spec sections 4.2.1, 4.2.8, 5.1, 7.2.1, 7.2.3, Story 1.2 patterns), 7 code artifacts (FitmentBadge component with 3 variants, ProductCard integration, ShadCN Tooltip/Badge components, vehicle utilities, FilterContext), dependency manifest (React 19, Next.js 15, TypeScript, Radix UI Tooltip, Lucide React icons), 4 API interfaces (FitmentBadgeProps, matchVehicle, VehicleSelection, Tooltip components), 12 development constraints (Next.js Server Components, TypeScript strict mode, ShadCN patterns, WCAG AA accessibility, dark mode support, responsive design), and 14 test ideas mapped to all 7 acceptance criteria. **IMPLEMENTATION STATUS:** FitmentBadge component and ProductCard integration already exist from Story 1.2 work. Needs verification of all ACs, accessibility testing (screen readers, keyboard navigation, color contrast), and formal completion documentation. Next: DEV agent should run dev-story to verify and mark complete. Progress: 100%.

**2025-10-15**: Story 1.8 (Visual Fitment Compatibility Indicators) marked ready for development by SM agent. Moved from TODO → IN PROGRESS. Story 1.4 (Product Search Functionality) moved from BACKLOG → TODO. Story file status updated to "Ready". Next: Generate implementation context with story-context workflow, then implement with dev-story. Progress: 99.5%.

**2025-10-15**: Completed create-story for Story 1.8 (Visual Fitment Compatibility Indicators). Story file: story-1.8.md. Status: Draft (needs review via story-ready). Story includes 7 acceptance criteria, 5 tasks (35 subtasks), dev notes with architecture context. Builds on vehicle fitment infrastructure from Story 1.2 (matchVehicle, FilterContext). Focuses on visual badge component with 3 variants (compatible, check-fitment, universal) using ShadCN Badge and Tooltip components. Technical approach: Create FitmentBadge.tsx with green "Fits Your [Model]" badge (with year tooltip), yellow "Check Fitment" warning badge (with tooltip explanation), and gray "Universal Fit" badge. Integrate into ProductCard component to display appropriate badge based on matchVehicle result when vehicle is selected. Accessibility: WCAG AA compliant (icons + text, proper color contrast, keyboard accessible tooltips, screen reader support). Next: Review and approve story with story-ready workflow. Progress: 99%.

**2025-10-15**: Story 1.2 (Vehicle Fitment Filter - Year-Make-Model) approved and marked done by DEV agent. Moved from IN PROGRESS → DONE. Story 1.8 (Visual Fitment Compatibility Indicators) moved from BACKLOG → TODO. Total completed: 3 stories (18 points). Backlog now 8 stories (62 points). Next: SM agent should draft Story 1.8. Progress: 98%.

**2025-10-15**: Completed story-context for Story 1.2 (Vehicle Fitment Filter - Year-Make-Model). Context file: story-context-1.2.xml. Context includes: 8 documentation references (PRD sections, UX spec sections 3.4, 4.2.1, 4.2.3, 5.1, epic-stories, Story 1.3 patterns), 9 code artifacts (FilterContext, filter types/utils, FilterPanel, FilterBadges, ProductCard, Shopify types, ShadCN components), dependency manifest (Node.js, React 19, Next.js 15, TypeScript, ShadCN Select component needs installation), 11 API interfaces (VehicleSelection, ParsedFitmentTag, extended FilterState, parseFitmentTag, extractModelOptions, matchVehicle functions, localStorage API), 14 development constraints (Next.js 15 Server Components, localStorage persistence for vehicle, AND logic filtering, Shopify tag format "BMW [Model] [Trim] [Year]", ShadCN components, accessibility, Tailwind CSS with dark mode, mobile-first responsive), and 15 test ideas mapped to all 8 acceptance criteria. Next: DEV agent should run dev-story to implement. Progress: 97%.

**2025-10-15**: Story 1.2 (Vehicle Fitment Filter - Year-Make-Model) marked ready for development by SM agent. Moved from TODO → IN PROGRESS. Story file status updated to "Ready". Next: Generate implementation context with story-context workflow, then implement with dev-story. Progress: 96%.

**2025-10-15**: Completed create-story for Story 1.2 (Vehicle Fitment Filter - Year-Make-Model). Story file: story-1.2.md. Status: Draft (needs review via story-ready). Story includes 8 acceptance criteria, 7 tasks (47 subtasks), dev notes with architecture context and references to PRD, UX spec, epic breakdown, and Story 1.3 filter patterns. **CRITICAL UPDATE:** Story revised based on actual Shopify tag format from distributor screenshots - tags use format "BMW [Model] [Trim] [Year]" (e.g., "BMW X4 xDrive30i 2022", "BMW 335i Base 2010") with individual years (not ranges), full model names (X3, X4, 335i) not chassis codes (E46, F30), and trim info that will be ignored for filtering. Model dropdown will be populated dynamically from available product tags. Vehicle fitment filtering is the core differentiator for the BMW parts marketplace - filters products by selected year/model, persists to localStorage, displays fitment badges on product cards, and integrates with existing FilterContext infrastructure from Story 1.3. Technical approach: Parse tags with regex, extract model and year, extend FilterContext to include vehicle selection, create VehicleSelector component with dynamic Model/Year dropdowns, implement exact matching logic in filterProducts() utility, and display "✓ Fits Your [Model]" badges on compatible products. Next: Review and approve story with story-ready workflow. Progress: 95%.
