## Bulk Image Upload

### Gallery Fields

The vehicle schema has 5 gallery fields:
- **Gallery Exterior 1** - Up to 25 images
- **Gallery Exterior 2** - Up to 25 images
- **Gallery Exterior 3** - Up to 25 images
- **Gallery Interior 1** - Up to 25 images
- **Gallery Interior 2** - Up to 25 images

### How to Upload Multiple Images at Once

#### Method 1: Drag and Drop (Recommended)

1. Open the gallery field you want to add to
2. Select multiple images in your file browser:
   - Windows: Hold `Ctrl` and click each image
   - Mac: Hold `Cmd` and click each image
   - Or click first image, hold `Shift`, click last image (selects range)
3. Drag all selected images into the gallery field
4. Wait for upload progress to complete
5. Images appear as thumbnails in the field

#### Method 2: Click to Browse

1. Click the "+ Select image" button
2. Hold `Ctrl` (Windows) or `Cmd` (Mac) and select multiple files
3. Click "Open"
4. Wait for upload to complete

### Best Practices

**Image Coverage:**
- Exterior: Front, rear, both sides, 3/4 angles, wheels, details, badges
- Interior: Dashboard, seats, door panels, headliner, trunk, controls, special features

**Optimal Formats:**
- JPEG for photos (preferred)
- Max 2MB per image (larger images will slow uploads)
- High resolution but web-optimized

**Adding Descriptions (Optional but recommended):**
1. Click the pencil icon on any uploaded image
2. Fill in:
   - **Alt Text** (SEO): "Front view of BMW M5", "M5 rear quarter panel"
   - **Caption** (Optional): "Recently detailed", "New wheels installed"

### Upload Progress

- Progress bar shows during bulk uploads
- Large batches (20-30 images) may take 1-3 minutes
- Don't close the browser until complete
- If upload fails, try smaller batches (10-15 at a time)

## Draft/Publish Workflow

### Understanding Drafts

- **Draft**: Work in progress, NOT live on website
- **Published**: Live and visible to public

### Working with Drafts

1. **Create Draft:**
   - Make any edits to a vehicle
   - Changes auto-save as a draft
   - Look for "DRAFT" label at top

2. **Preview Draft Changes:**
   - Click the **"Preview"** button (üëÅÔ∏è icon, top right toolbar)
   - Opens draft version on live website
   - URL includes `/api/preview?...`
   - Only you can see this preview (requires secret token)

3. **Publish Changes:**
   - Click **"Publish"** button
   - Removes "DRAFT" label
   - Changes go live on website
   - Triggers website revalidation (ISR)

4. **Discard Draft:**
   - Click the "‚ãÆ" menu (top right)
   - Select "Discard changes"
   - Reverts to last published version

### Preview vs Live

| Preview | Published |
|---------|----------|
| Only visible to you | Public on website |
| Requires preview URL | Normal vehicle URL |
| No ISR revalidation | Triggers ISR update |
| Draft label visible | No draft label |

**Tip:** Always preview major changes before publishing!

## SEO Best Practices

### Listing Title

‚úÖ **Good Examples:**
- "2003 BMW E39 M5 6-Speed Manual"
- "2015 BMW F80 M3 Competition Package"
- "1995 BMW E36 M3 Lightweight"

‚ùå **Poor Examples:**
- "M5" (too short, no year/chassis)
- "Super Clean BMW!!!" (unprofessional, excessive punctuation)
- "2003 BMW E39 M5 6-Speed Manual Transmission with Navigation and Heated Seats" (too long)

### Alt Text for Images

‚úÖ **Good Examples:**
- "Front 3/4 view of silver 2003 BMW M5"
- "BMW M5 interior showing caramel leather seats"
- "Close-up of BMW M5 S62 V8 engine bay"

‚ùå **Poor Examples:**
- "IMG_1234.jpg" (filename, not descriptive)
- "Car" (too vague)
- Left blank (missed SEO opportunity)

### Overview Content

**Tips:**
1. Use natural language (write for humans, not robots)
2. Include relevant keywords organically:
   - Model names (M5, E39, etc.)
   - Features (manual transmission, navigation, etc.)
   - Condition descriptors (clean, excellent, original, etc.)
3. Break into sections with H2/H3 headings
4. Tell the story - what makes this vehicle special?

**Example Structure:**
```
## Overview
Brief introduction to the vehicle...

## Condition
Exterior, interior, mechanical condition details...

## Service History
Recent work, maintenance records...

## Modifications
Any upgrades or changes from stock...

## Why This Car Is Special
What sets it apart from others...
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Validation Failed" Error

**Cause:** Required fields are missing or invalid

**Solution:**
1. Read the error message (tells you which field)
2. Scroll to that field (highlighted in red)
3. Fill or correct the field
4. Try publishing again

**Common Validation Errors:**

| Error | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| "Title must be between 10-100 characters" | Make title longer or shorter |
| "Slug is required" | Click "Generate" button next to Slug field |
| "VIN must be exactly 17 characters" | Check VIN length and format |
| "Price must be a positive number" | Enter a number greater than 0 |
| "Signature shot is required" | Upload a hero image |

### Images Won't Upload

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
1. Check image file size (keep under 2MB each)
2. Try uploading fewer images at once (10 instead of 30)
3. Check internet connection
4. Try a different browser
5. Clear browser cache and retry

### Preview Button Not Working

**Cause:** Slug not generated or invalid preview configuration

**Solution:**
1. Ensure Slug field is filled (click "Generate")
2. Save/publish the document first
3. Refresh the page
4. Try preview again

### Changes Not Appearing on Website

**Solution:**
1. Ensure you clicked **"Publish"** (not just saved draft)
2. Wait 60 seconds for ISR revalidation
3. Hard refresh the browser: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
4. Check if vehicle status is "Current" (not "Sold" or "Draft")

### Can't Find a Vehicle

**Solution:**
1. Check which view you're in:
   - Drafts only show unpublished work
   - Current Inventory only shows status: "current"
   - Sold Vehicles only shows status: "sold"
2. Try "All Vehicles" view for complete list
3. Use search bar at top (search by title, VIN, stock number)

### Lost Work / Accidental Changes

**Solution:**
1. Click document history icon (clock icon, top right)
2. Browse previous versions
3. Click "Restore" on the version you want
4. Publish to make it live again
