- **Mitigation in Architecture:**
  - Clear upgrade path to Meilisearch Cloud:line_number:46
  - Phased approach (2a: Fuse.js, 2b: Meilisearch)
  - Monitoring triggers defined (>200 items or >300ms latency)
- **Status:** ✅ MITIGATED

**Risk 4: NextAuth.js Beta Version**
- **Threat:** NextAuth.js 5.0.0-beta may have stability issues
- **Mitigation in Architecture:**
  - Beta version is production-ready (documented by NextAuth team)
  - Database sessions provide fallback resilience

   - Budget allocation: Meilisearch Cloud ~$29/month when needed

2. **Analytics Tooling**
   - Consider Vercel Analytics (free tier) or PostHog for product analytics
   - Track conversion funnels: vehicle view → parts click → purchase
   - A/B testing infrastructure if needed for optimization

3. **NextAuth.js Beta Monitoring**
   - Monitor stability in production
   - Plan migration to stable v5 release when available
   - Document any beta-related issues encountered

4. **Image Bandwidth Tracking**
   - Implement weekly Vercel bandwidth dashboard checks (per user request)
   - Set alert threshold at 80% of free tier limit
   - Review Sanity CDN usage monthly
