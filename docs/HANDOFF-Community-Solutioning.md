**Goals:**
1. Increase User Engagement (DAU, session duration, return visits)
2. Build Enthusiast Network (knowledge sharing, connections)
3. Enhance Brand Authority (thought leadership, BMW community hub)

**Key Features:**
- Community feed with sorting (Popular, New, Top)
- Topic-based communities (E30, E36, E46, M3, Parts & Builds)
- Post creation with rich text + images
- Staff badges for admin content
- Admin pinning/featuring
- Comments with threading
- Upvoting system
- User profiles
- Search & notifications

**Technical Foundation:**
- Builds on Epic 5 (NextAuth.js, User Management) ‚úÖ Complete
- Integrates with Epic 6 (Fuse.js Search) ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial
- Uses existing ShadCN UI components
- Vercel Blob for image uploads (from Story 5.3)

## üöÄ Next Session: Solution Architecture (Option A)

### What to Generate

**Primary Output:** `docs/solution-architecture-community.md`

**Required Sections:**
1. **Database Schema Design**
   - Post table (id, title, body, imageUrl, authorId, communityId, isPinned, isStaffPost, createdAt, updatedAt)
   - Comment table (id, body, postId, authorId, parentCommentId, createdAt)
   - Community table (id, name, slug, description, iconUrl)
   - Upvote table (id, userId, postId?, commentId?, createdAt)
   - Notification table (id, userId, type, actorId, postId?, commentId?, read, createdAt)
   - Foreign keys, indexes, relationships

2. **API Route Architecture**
   - `/api/community/posts` - CRUD operations
   - `/api/community/posts/[id]/comments` - Comment management
   - `/api/community/posts/[id]/upvote` - Upvote toggle
   - `/api/community/communities` - List communities
   - `/api/community/feed` - Feed with sorting/filtering
   - `/api/community/search` - Search posts
   - `/api/notifications` - Notification system
   - Admin routes for pinning, moderation

3. **Component Hierarchy**
   - Pages: CommunityFeedPage, PostDetailPage, CreatePostPage, CommunityPage, UserProfilePage
   - Components: PostCard, CommentThread, UpvoteButton, PostForm, CommunityFilter, StaffBadge
   - Layouts: CommunityLayout with sidebar

4. **Integration Patterns**
   - Auth: How to extend User model with `role` field
   - Search: How to integrate with Story 6.1 Fuse.js infrastructure
   - Navigation: Adding Community link to DesktopNavbar/ExpandedNavbar
   - Images: Reusing Vercel Blob upload pattern from Story 5.3

5. **Caching Strategy**
   - Feed caching (Redis or in-memory for MVP?)
   - Post detail caching
   - Community list caching
   - Cache invalidation on new posts/comments

6. **Security Considerations**
   - Rate limiting (5 posts/hour per user)
   - CSRF protection on forms
   - XSS prevention in rich text
   - Admin permission checks
   - Content moderation approach

7. **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**
   - ADR-001: Rich text editor choice (TipTap, Slate, or Lexical?)
   - ADR-002: Rate limiting implementation (Redis vs in-memory)
   - ADR-003: Notification system approach (polling vs WebSocket for MVP)
   - ADR-004: Image storage strategy (Vercel Blob structure)
   - ADR-005: Community feed pagination (cursor vs offset)

## üé¨ How to Start Next Session

### Option 1: Via PM Agent (Recommended)

```bash
# Load PM agent
/bmad:bmm:agents:pm

# Then run solutioning workflow
# Select option: 3-solutioning or equivalent menu item
```

### Option 2: Direct Workflow Load

Tell Claude:

```
"Load the solution architecture workflow for the Community feature.

Context:
- PRD Complete: docs/PRD-Community.md
- Epic Breakdown: docs/epic-stories-community.md
- Handoff Doc: docs/HANDOFF-Community-Solutioning.md
- Generate: docs/solution-architecture-community.md

Project: Enthusiast Auto Community Feature
Level: 2 (Focused feature system)
Type: Web Application (brownfield)
Dependencies: Epic 5 (Auth) complete, Epic 6 (Search) partial

Run Option A: Full solution architecture (30-45 min)
"
```

### Option 3: Manual Architecture Generation

If workflows have issues, you can manually guide Claude:

```
"Create solution architecture for Community feature based on:
- PRD: docs/PRD-Community.md
- Epics: docs/epic-stories-community.md

Generate comprehensive architecture covering:
1. Database schema (Prisma)
2. API routes structure
3. Component hierarchy
4. Integration with existing auth/search
5. Caching strategy
6. Security approach
7. ADRs for key decisions

Output to: docs/solution-architecture-community.md
"
```

## üí° Key Decisions Made

1. **Manual Blog Migration** - No automated migration (only a few posts exist)
2. **MVP Approach** - Early user testing before full rollout
3. **No Community Moderators** - Admin-only moderation for MVP
4. **Basic Notifications** - Simple polling, no real-time WebSockets for MVP
5. **Phased Delivery** - Epic 7 (4 weeks) ‚Üí Epic 8 (3 weeks)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Gaps to Address in Solutioning

1. **Story 8.7 Enhancement** - Explicitly integrate with Story 6.1 Fuse.js infrastructure
2. **Navigation Integration** - Add Community link to main nav (Story 7.2 or separate story?)
3. **Image Upload Verification** - Confirm Vercel Blob is configured (from Story 5.3)
4. **Rich Text Editor Choice** - Select editor in architecture phase (TipTap recommended)
5. **Rate Limiting Strategy** - Decide Redis vs in-memory for MVP

---

## üéØ Success Criteria for Solutioning Phase

Architecture document should provide enough detail for:
- ‚úÖ Story 7.1 can be implemented immediately (database schema ready)
- ‚úÖ Developers understand all API routes needed
- ‚úÖ Component structure is clear and follows existing patterns
- ‚úÖ Integration with Epic 5 (Auth) and Epic 6 (Search) is explicit
- ‚úÖ Security considerations are documented
- ‚úÖ Technical decisions are recorded in ADRs

## üìû Questions to Answer in Solutioning

1. Which rich text editor? (TipTap, Slate, Lexical)
2. Redis for rate limiting or in-memory for MVP?
3. Cursor-based or offset pagination for feed?
4. WebSocket notifications or polling for MVP?
5. How to structure Vercel Blob image paths?
6. Community search: extend Story 6.1 API or separate endpoint?
7. Post slugs: auto-generated or user-defined?
