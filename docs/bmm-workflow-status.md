Progress: 98%.

**2025-10-15**: Completed story-context for Story 1.2 (Vehicle Fitment Filter - Year-Make-Model). Context file: story-context-1.2.xml. Context includes: 8 documentation references (PRD sections, UX spec sections 3.4, 4.2.1, 4.2.3, 5.1, epic-stories, Story 1.3 patterns), 9 code artifacts (FilterContext, filter types/utils, FilterPanel, FilterBadges, ProductCard, Shopify types, ShadCN components), dependency manifest (Node.js, React 19, Next.js 15, TypeScript, ShadCN Select component needs installation), 11 API interfaces (VehicleSelection, ParsedFitmentTag, extended FilterState, parseFitmentTag, extractModelOptions, matchVehicle functions, localStorage API), 14 development constraints (Next.js 15 Server Components, localStorage persistence for vehicle, AND logic filtering, Shopify tag format "BMW [Model] [Trim] [Year]", ShadCN components, accessibility, Tailwind CSS with dark mode, mobile-first responsive), and 15 test ideas mapped to all 8 acceptance criteria. Next: DEV agent should run dev-story to implement. Progress: 97%.

**2025-10-15**: Story 1.2 (Vehicle Fitment Filter - Year-Make-Model) marked ready for development by SM agent. Moved from TODO → IN PROGRESS. Story file status updated to "Ready". Next: Generate implementation context with story-context workflow, then implement with dev-story. Progress: 96%.

**2025-10-15**: Completed create-story for Story 1.2 (Vehicle Fitment Filter - Year-Make-Model). Story file: story-1.2.md. Status: Draft (needs review via story-ready). Story includes 8 acceptance criteria, 7 tasks (47 subtasks), dev notes with architecture context and references to PRD, UX spec, epic breakdown, and Story 1.3 filter patterns. **CRITICAL UPDATE:** Story revised based on actual Shopify tag format from distributor screenshots - tags use format "BMW [Model] [Trim] [Year]" (e.g., "BMW X4 xDrive30i 2022", "BMW 335i Base 2010") with individual years (not ranges), full model names (X3, X4, 335i) not chassis codes (E46, F30), and trim info that will be ignored for filtering. Model dropdown will be populated dynamically from available product tags. Vehicle fitment filtering is the core differentiator for the BMW parts marketplace - filters products by selected year/model, persists to localStorage, displays fitment badges on product cards, and integrates with existing FilterContext infrastructure from Story 1.3. Technical approach: Parse tags with regex, extract model and year, extend FilterContext to include vehicle selection, create VehicleSelector component with dynamic Model/Year dropdowns, implement exact matching logic in filterProducts() utility, and display "✓ Fits Your [Model]" badges on compatible products.
