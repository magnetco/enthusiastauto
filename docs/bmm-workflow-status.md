## Decisions Log

**2025-10-28 - Story 10.1 Complete (Design System Audit):** Completed dev-story for Story 10.1 (Design System Audit & Documentation Sync). All 8 tasks and 50+ subtasks checked off. Created comprehensive design-system-audit-2025-10-28.md (400+ lines) documenting: (1) Page-by-page audit of 7 pages with token usage scores (services 95% gold standard, profile 35% worst), (2) CRITICAL WCAG violations - Profile page has 6+ contrast failures with text-gray-900 on dark bg (#08090a on #141721 = 1.05:1 ratio, virtually invisible), garage page expected similar issues, (3) Component comparison - ProductCard vs VehicleCard dramatically different (aspect ratios 1:1 vs 4:3, padding 10px vs 16px, ProductCard uses semantic tokens ✅, VehicleCard hardcoded colors ❌), (4) Design token usage matrix showing hardcoded values in vehicles/profile pages, (5) Font family decision: KEEP Figtree (update docs) - rationale: already implemented, excellent readability, no user benefit to switch to Inter/Outfit, avoid performance/layout risks, (6) Uppercase transform on ALL headings (line 335 globals.css) flagged for removal in Story 10.2, (7) Detailed recommendations for Stories 10.2-10.5 with effort estimates (10.3 CRITICAL 8pts 6-8hrs, 10.2 medium 5pts 3-4hrs, 10.4 high 8pts 6-8hrs, 10.5 low 5pts 4-5hrs). Completely rewrote design-system.md to synchronize with implementation: updated font to Figtree, brand colors to blue primary, typography to Linear system (14px base), added comprehensive color token docs, spacing patterns, shadow system, animation timing, accessibility standards, best practices with services page as example. All 8 acceptance criteria met. Story status: Ready for Review. Progress: 53.5% (91/170 points, 15/25 stories complete). 🚨 CRITICAL BLOCKER: Profile/garage accessibility violations (severity 5/5) block production - must implement Story 10.3 IMMEDIATELY before any other Epic 10 work. Next: User reviews audit findings, then create/implement Story 10.3 (Color System & Critical Accessibility Fixes).

**2025-10-28 - Story 10.1 Context Generated:** Completed story-context workflow for Story 10.1 (Design System Audit & Documentation Sync). Context file: `docs/stories/story-context-10.10.1.xml`.
