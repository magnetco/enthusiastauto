**Author:** Mike
**Date:** 2025-10-14

**Project Type:** Web Application
**Target Scale:** 5-15 stories, 1-2 epics, focused PRD + solutioning handoff

---

## Description, Context and Goals

### Description

Transform the existing template into a production-ready BMW parts e-commerce platform that integrates with Shopify inventory. The site will serve as a curated marketplace for BMW enthusiasts, hosted at shop.enthusiastauto.com, featuring intelligent vehicle fitment filtering as the core differentiation. The platform emphasizes simplicity and usability over feature bloat, delivering a streamlined purchasing experience with modern design aesthetics using ShadCN components and Webflow Devlink integration.

**Key Differentiators:**

- **Vehicle Fitment Filtering**: Advanced filtering by year-make-model tags to help customers find compatible parts
- **Curated BMW Parts Selection**: Quality-focused product catalog rather than overwhelming inventory
- **Modern, Delightful UX**: Superior design compared to the main enthusiastauto.com site
- **Cross-Site Integration**: Persistent cart handling between shop.enthusiastauto.com and enthusiastauto.com
- **Template-Friendly Architecture**: Built on commerce template for straightforward Shopify integration

### Deployment Intent

**MVP for Early Users** - This will be a functional site deployed for initial customer testing and feedback. The goal is to validate the approach with real BMW enthusiasts while iterating based on their usage patterns and feedback.

### Context

The enthusiastauto.com main website showcases vehicles in stock for sale and provides BMW service facility information for collectible and all BMW models. However, there is currently no dedicated, optimized e-commerce experience for BMW parts purchasing. With Shopify handling inventory and fulfillment operations, there's an opportunity to launch a specialized parts marketplace at shop.enthusiastauto.com that complements the vehicle sales and service business. The existing commerce template provides a technical foundation, but requires transformation into a production-ready platform with intelligent fitment filtering and cross-site integration. This project establishes the digital storefront for a curated BMW parts business, enabling customers to confidently purchase compatible parts while maintaining brand consistency with the main enthusiastauto.com property.

### Goals

1. **Launch a functional BMW parts marketplace** that enables customers to discover, filter, and purchase parts with seamless Shopify integration
2. **Validate the vehicle fitment filtering approach** to ensure customers can easily find compatible parts for their specific BMW year-make-model combinations
3. **Establish a superior UX baseline** that differentiates shop.enthusiastauto.com from the main site and sets a new standard for automotive e-commerce usability

## User Journeys

### Primary User Journey: Finding and Purchasing Compatible BMW Parts

**Persona:** Alex - BMW E46 M3 owner looking for performance exhaust parts

**Journey:**

1. **Discover** - Alex arrives at shop.enthusiastauto.com from the main enthusiastauto.com site or search
2. **Select Vehicle** - Selects BMW make (pre-set), then chooses "E46" model and "2001-2006" year range
3. **Browse & Filter** - Views exhaust category, applies vendor filter (e.g., "Akrapovic", "Borla"), sees only compatible parts with clear fitment indicators
4. **Compare Options** - Uses side-by-side comparison to evaluate 2-3 exhaust systems based on specs, price, and reviews
5. **Review Details** - Opens detailed product page, confirms fitment compatibility, views installation notes and images
6. **Add to Cart** - Adds selected exhaust to cart, sees clear confirmation
7. **Checkout** - Proceeds through standard Shopify checkout with saved cart state
8. **Confirmation** - Receives order confirmation with tracking info

**Key Touchpoints:**

- Vehicle selection is intuitive and remembered across sessions
- Fitment filtering eliminates incompatible parts immediately
- Comparison feature helps decision-making without leaving the flow
- Visual indicators build confidence in compatibility

## UX Design Principles

1. **Clarity Over Cleverness** - Use straightforward, industry-standard e-commerce patterns rather than novel interactions
2. **Fitment First** - Vehicle compatibility should be immediately obvious at every touchpoint
3. **Progressive Disclosure** - Show essential information upfront, details on demand
4. **Touch-Friendly Mobile** - Mobile users are primary; all interactions optimized for touch
5. **Fast Feedback** - Every user action receives immediate visual confirmation

## Epics

### Epic 1: Core E-commerce Foundation & Vehicle Fitment

**Goal:** Establish the essential BMW parts marketplace with intelligent fitment filtering

**Stories:** 8 stories covering product listing, vehicle fitment filtering, search, cart, and responsive design

**Priority:** Must Have - Core MVP functionality
**Estimated Complexity:** Medium

---

### Epic 2: Enhanced UX & Cross-Site Integration

**Goal:** Deliver superior user experience and seamless integration with main site

**Stories:** 4 stories covering product comparison, ShadCN design system, Webflow Devlink integration, and persistent cart

**Priority:** Should Have - Differentiation features
**Estimated Complexity:** Medium-High (cross-site integration stories are complex)

---

**Sequencing Notes:**

- Epic 1 should be completed first as it establishes core functionality
- Stories 11-12 in Epic 2 (Webflow Devlink, Persistent Cart) can be deferred if integration complexity requires additional sprint
- This allows early deployment with Epic 1 complete

_See epic-stories.md for detailed story breakdown with acceptance criteria_

## Out of Scope

The following features are explicitly out of scope for this MVP and reserved for future iterations:

- **Custom Checkout Flow** - Checkout is handled entirely by Shopify (payment, shipping, order confirmation)
- **User Accounts & Profiles** - No registration/login beyond Shopify guest checkout
- **Wishlist/Favorites** - Not included in MVP
- **Product Reviews & Ratings** - Will leverage Shopify reviews if/when needed
- **Advanced Recommendations** - No ML-based product recommendations
- **Live Chat Support** - Customer support handled externally
- **Multi-Currency/Internationalization** - US market only for MVP
- **Email Marketing Integration** - Handled separately in Shopify
- **Inventory Management Tools** - Admin functions remain in Shopify

---

## Next Steps

### Phase 2: UX Specification (Highly Recommended)

Since this project has significant UI components, the next step is to create a comprehensive UX specification document:

- Run the **ux-spec** workflow to define detailed user flows, wireframes, and component specifications
- This ensures design decisions are made before implementation begins

**Command:** `/bmad:pm:ux-spec`

### Phase 4: Implementation

After UX specification is complete:

1. **Story Refinement** - SM (Scrum Master) will refine stories with technical details
2. **Sprint Planning** - Prioritize and sequence stories for development
3. **Development** - Implement stories iteratively using the dev-story workflow
