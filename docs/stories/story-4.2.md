## Dev Notes

### Architecture Patterns and Constraints

**Homepage Rendering Strategy (Source: docs/solution-architecture.md#2.2):**
- Homepage uses ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) with 60s revalidation
- Hybrid approach balances freshness (vehicle inventory changes) and performance (cached static pages)
- Server Components for data fetching (vehicles from Sanity, products from Shopify)
- Client Components only where needed (interactive elements like "Add to Cart")

**Dual-CMS Data Fetching (Source: docs/solution-architecture.md#2.4):**
- **Sanity CMS (Vehicles):** Fetch featured vehicles using GROQ query, disable CDN for fresh data
- **Shopify API (Products):** Use existing `shopifyFetch` function from Phase 1 with 300s cache
- Both sources fetched in parallel for optimal performance
- In-memory cache strategy for API rate limiting (free tier)

**ISR Configuration Example:**
```typescript
// app/page.tsx
export const revalidate = 60; // ISR: revalidate every 60 seconds

export default async function HomePage() {
  const [vehicles, products] = await Promise.all([
    getVehicles({ status: 'current', limit: 4 }), // Sanity
    getFeaturedProducts({ limit: 8 }) // Shopify
  ]);

  return <HomepageContent vehicles={vehicles} products={products} />;
}
```

**Performance Requirements (Source: docs/PRD.md - NFR001, NFR005):**
- Page load: <2s on standard broadband
- Lighthouse Performance: 85+ target
- Mobile-first design (60%+ traffic expected)
- Images: Optimized via Next.js Image component (<100KB per thumbnail)

**SEO Requirements (Source: docs/PRD.md - NFR010):**
- Lighthouse SEO score: 95+
- Schema.org Organization markup for brand identity
- Proper meta tags: title, description, Open Graph for social sharing
- Semantic HTML with clear heading hierarchy (H1 for hero, H2 for sections)

### Source Tree Components to Touch

**Files to Modify:**
- `app/page.tsx` - Homepage route (existing file from Phase 1, needs redesign)
- Implement ISR with dual-CMS data fetching
- Replace placeholder content with unified platform homepage

**Files to Create:**
- `components/shared/HeroSection.tsx` - Hero with value proposition and CTAs
- `components/shared/FeaturedVehicles.tsx` - Server Component for vehicle highlights
- `components/shared/PopularParts.tsx` - Server Component for parts showcase
- `components/shared/AboutSection.tsx` - Brand story and value props
- `lib/sanity/queries.ts` - Add `getFeaturedVehicles` GROQ query (if not exists)
- `lib/shopify/queries.ts` - Add `getFeaturedProducts` query (if not exists)

**Files to Reference:**
- `lib/sanity/client.ts` - Sanity client setup (Epic 3 implementation)
- `lib/shopify/client.ts` - Shopify API client (Phase 1 proven)
- `components/vehicles/VehicleCard.tsx` - Reuse or adapt for featured vehicles (Epic 3)
- `components/product/ProductCard.tsx` - Reuse for popular parts (Phase 1)
- `components/ui/button.tsx` - ShadCN Button for CTAs

**Testing Files:**
- Create `app/page.test.tsx` - Unit tests for homepage rendering
- Create `e2e/homepage.spec.ts` - Playwright E2E tests for user flows

### Testing Standards Summary

**Unit Testing (Vitest):**
- Test homepage renders all sections (hero, featured vehicles, popular parts, about)
- Test data fetching functions (getFeaturedVehicles, getFeaturedProducts)
- Mock Sanity and Shopify API calls with sample data
- Verify correct props passed to child components

**E2E Testing (Playwright):**
- Load homepage and verify all sections visible
- Click "Browse Vehicles" CTA → verify navigation to /vehicles
- Click "Shop Parts" CTA → verify navigation to /products
- Test mobile viewport: verify responsive layout (stacked sections)
- Test desktop viewport: verify grid layouts for cards
- Verify hero image loads with correct optimization

**Performance Testing:**
- Run Lighthouse Performance audit (target 85+)
- Verify page load <2s on 3G throttling (Lighthouse mobile simulation)
- Check Total Blocking Time (TBT) <300ms
- Monitor Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) <2.5s

**Accessibility Testing:**
- Run axe-core on homepage
- Verify all CTAs have accessible labels and focus indicators
- Check heading hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3)
- Test keyboard navigation through all interactive elements
- Verify images have descriptive alt text

**Visual Regression:**
- Screenshot homepage on mobile (375px), tablet (768px), desktop (1280px)
- Verify consistent brand colors and spacing
- Compare with design mockups (if available)

### Project Structure Notes

**Alignment with Unified Project Structure:**
- Homepage at `app/page.tsx` aligns with Next.js App Router convention
- Shared components in `components/shared/` per architecture (Source: docs/solution-architecture.md#11.2)
- Server Components for data fetching, Client Components for interactivity
- Follows Phase 1 patterns for consistency (ProductCard, button styling)

**Naming Conventions:**
- PascalCase for component files: `HeroSection.tsx`, `FeaturedVehicles.tsx`
- camelCase for utility functions: `getFeaturedVehicles()`, `getFeaturedProducts()`
- Kebab-case for routes: `/vehicles`, `/products` (Next.js convention)

**Lessons from Story 4.1:**
- Server Component + Client Component composition works well for performance
- Reusing existing components (ProductCard from Phase 1) reduces development time
- Mobile-first approach ensures responsive design from the start
- Clear component boundaries (shared vs. layout vs. ui) simplifies maintenance

**Detected Conflicts:**
- Existing `app/page.tsx` may have placeholder content from template - needs full redesign
- Rationale: Homepage is now the unified platform entry point, not just parts showcase
