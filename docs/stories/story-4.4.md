# Story 4.4: Cross-Content Linking Components

Status: Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** user viewing a vehicle,
**I want to** see compatible parts recommendations,
**so that** I can discover parts for the vehicle I'm interested in.

**As a** user viewing a product,
**I want to** see which vehicles currently in stock use this part,
**so that** I can understand real-world fitment examples.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **AC1: Compatible Parts Section on Vehicle Detail Pages**
   - Vehicle detail pages (`/vehicles/[slug]`) display "Compatible Parts" section below gallery/specs
   - Section shows 4-6 relevant products from Shopify catalog
   - Part recommendations based on vehicle year, make, model, and chassis (fitment matching)
   - Each product card displays: image, title, price, vendor, "View Product" CTA
   - Section uses responsive grid layout (2 columns mobile, 3 columns tablet, 4 columns desktop)
   - Section appears after vehicle specs but before service history
   - ShadCN Card component used for consistent styling

2. **AC2: Fitment Matching Logic for Vehicle → Parts**
   - Recommendation engine matches vehicle.model (e.g., "E46") and vehicle.year against Shopify product tags
   - Tag format: "BMW E46 2001-2006" or "BMW E46" (parsed from Shopify product.tags array)
   - Logic handles year ranges correctly (e.g., E46 fits 1999-2006)
   - Universal fit products ("BMW Universal") included in recommendations
   - Results ranked by relevance: exact model+year match > model match > universal
   - Maximum 6 products returned to prevent UI overload
   - Logic implemented in `lib/shared/recommendations.ts` for testability

3. **AC3: Vehicles in Stock Section on Product Detail Pages**
   - Product detail pages (`/product/[handle]`) display "Vehicles in Stock" section below product details
   - Section shows vehicles from Sanity that match product's fitment tags
   - Only "current" status vehicles shown (sold vehicles excluded)
   - Each vehicle card displays: hero image, year/make/model, price, mileage, "View Vehicle" CTA
   - Section uses responsive grid layout (1 column mobile, 2 columns tablet/desktop)
   - Section appears after "Add to Cart" section but before "Related Products"
   - ShadCN Card component used for consistent styling

4. **AC4: Fitment Matching Logic for Product → Vehicles**
   - Recommendation engine matches product tags (e.g., "BMW E46 2001-2006") against vehicle.model and vehicle.year
   - Parse product tags to extract model and year range
   - Query Sanity for vehicles matching parsed fitment criteria
   - Filter results to only include vehicles with status === "current"
   - Results sorted by newest listing first (_createdAt descending)
   - Maximum 4 vehicles shown to keep section concise
   - Logic implemented in `lib/shared/recommendations.ts` alongside parts logic

5. **AC5: Navigation and Context Preservation**
   - Clicking on recommended product navigates to `/product/[handle]` page
   - Clicking on recommended vehicle navigates to `/vehicles/[slug]` page
   - Breadcrumb navigation updates correctly on destination page
   - Back button returns to previous page (vehicle or product)
   - No loss of scroll position when using browser back button
   - Links use Next.js Link component for client-side navigation
   - Links include proper aria-labels for accessibility

6. **AC6: Empty State Handling**
   - If no compatible parts found for vehicle, show message: "No compatible parts currently available. Check back soon or contact us for custom recommendations."
   - If no vehicles found for product, show message: "No vehicles currently in stock with this part. View our full inventory to explore available vehicles."
   - Empty state includes relevant CTA: "Browse All Parts" or "Browse All Vehicles"
   - Empty state uses ShadCN Alert component with info variant
   - Sections hidden entirely if zero recommendations (alternative to empty state)

7. **AC7: Reusable Components and Shared Logic**
   - `RecommendationCarousel.tsx` component in `components/shared/` handles both parts and vehicles display
   - Component accepts generic props: items (array), type ("product" | "vehicle"), title (string)
   - `CrossDiscoveryLinks.tsx` component wraps individual recommendation cards
   - Business logic abstracted to `lib/shared/recommendations.ts` with exported functions:
     - `getCompatibleParts(vehicle: Vehicle): Promise<Product[]>`
     - `getVehiclesWithPart(productTags: string[]): Promise<Vehicle[]>`
   - Components follow existing ShadCN patterns and Tailwind styling
   - TypeScript types defined in shared types files

8. **AC8: Performance and Caching**
   - Recommendation queries cached with 5-minute TTL to reduce API calls
   - In-memory cache implementation using `lib/cache/memory.ts`
   - Cache keys based on vehicle slug or product handle
   - Fallback to fresh query if cache miss
   - Page load time remains <2 seconds with recommendations (per NFR001)
   - Recommendations load server-side during page render (no client-side fetch shimmer)
   - Images lazy-loaded using Next.js Image component

9. **AC9: Testing Requirements**
   - Unit tests for `lib/shared/recommendations.ts` covering:
     - Fitment tag parsing (E46, E90, year ranges)
     - Match logic (exact, partial, universal)
     - Result ranking and limiting
   - Component tests for `RecommendationCarousel.tsx` covering:
     - Rendering with products and vehicles
     - Empty state display
     - Responsive grid layout
   - Integration tests verifying:
     - Vehicle page shows compatible parts
     - Product page shows matching vehicles
     - Navigation links work correctly
   - Test coverage target: 80%+ for recommendation logic

## Dev Notes

**Architecture Patterns:**
- **Dual-CMS Querying:** This story bridges Shopify (parts) and Sanity (vehicles) by querying both systems based on shared fitment data. Vehicle data lives in Sanity; product fitment tags live in Shopify.
- **Server Components:** All recommendation fetching happens server-side using Next.js 15 Server Components for optimal performance and SEO.
- **Shared Business Logic:** The `lib/shared/recommendations.ts` module centralizes all fitment matching logic, making it testable and reusable.
- **Component Composition:** `RecommendationCarousel` is a polymorphic component that handles both product and vehicle recommendations through props.

**Fitment Matching Strategy (per solution-architecture.md):**
```typescript
// Vehicle → Compatible Parts
export async function getCompatibleParts(vehicle: Vehicle) {
  const fitmentTag = `BMW ${vehicle.model} ${vehicle.year}`;

  return shopifyFetch(`
    query($tag: String!) {
      products(first: 6, query: $tag) {
        edges {
          node { id, title, priceRange, images, vendor }
        }
      }
    }
  `, { variables: { tag: fitmentTag } });
}

// Product → Vehicles in Stock
export async function getVehiclesWithPart(productTags: string[]) {
  // Parse tags to extract model (E46, E90) and year range
  const models = extractModelsFromTags(productTags);

  return sanityClient.fetch(`
    *[_type == "vehicle" && model in $models && status == "current"] | order(_createdAt desc) [0...4] {
      slug, year, make, model, price, mileage, signatureShot
    }
  `, { models });
}
```

**Testing Standards:**
- Unit tests use Vitest for recommendation logic (parsing, matching, ranking)
- Component tests use React Testing Library for UI behavior
- Integration tests verify cross-CMS data flow
- Test fixtures include realistic vehicle/product data with various fitment tags

**Performance Considerations:**
- In-memory cache reduces redundant API calls (5-minute TTL)
- Server-side rendering eliminates client-side loading states
- Lazy-load images in recommendation sections
- Limit results to prevent UI overload (6 parts max, 4 vehicles max)

### Project Structure Notes

**Alignment with Unified Project Structure:**
- `lib/shared/recommendations.ts` - New shared logic module (follows `/lib/shared/` pattern from solution-architecture.md)
- `lib/cache/memory.ts` - New caching utility (follows `/lib/cache/` pattern)
- `components/shared/RecommendationCarousel.tsx` - New shared component
- `components/shared/CrossDiscoveryLinks.tsx` - New shared component (optional if functionality merged into carousel)
- Integration points: `app/vehicles/[slug]/page.tsx` (existing), `app/product/[handle]/page.tsx` (existing)

**No Detected Conflicts:**
- Story builds on existing vehicle and product detail pages from Epic 3 and Phase 1
- Follows established ShadCN component patterns
- Reuses existing Shopify and Sanity client configurations
- Aligns with routing structure from Story 4.3
