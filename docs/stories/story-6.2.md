# Story 6.2: Unified Search UI & Results Page

Status: Done

## Story

As a **user**,
I want **to search for vehicles or parts from a single search bar with autocomplete suggestions and view results on a dedicated search page**,
so that **I can quickly find what I'm looking for across both vehicle inventory and parts catalog**.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Search Bar in Header** - Search bar prominently placed in unified navigation header, accessible on all pages with consistent positioning
2. **Autocomplete Suggestions** - Search autocomplete shows relevant suggestions as user types (debounced 300ms), displaying both vehicles and parts
3. **Search Results Page** - Dedicated search results page at /search displays unified results from both Sanity (vehicles) and Shopify (parts)
4. **Result Type Filtering** - Users can filter results by type using tabs/buttons: "All", "Vehicles", "Parts" with result counts per type
5. **Result Display Format** - Each result shows thumbnail image, title, price, and relevance snippet with clear visual distinction between vehicles and parts
6. **Pagination/Infinite Scroll** - Large result sets support pagination or infinite scroll to handle 20+ results per query
7. **Empty State Handling** - No results state displays helpful suggestions (clear filters, browse categories, check spelling) with links to popular pages
8. **Query Term Highlighting** - Search highlights matching query terms within result titles and descriptions for easy scanning

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

**Epic 6 Context:**
- Story 6.1 (Complete) implemented unified search infrastructure with Fuse.js
- Story 6.2 (Current) builds user-facing search UI and results page
- Story 6.3 (Future) will add recommendation engine
- Story 6.4 (Future) will add SEO optimization

**Search API Integration:**
- Search API endpoint: `GET /api/search?q={query}&type={vehicles|parts|all}&limit={20}`
- Response format: `{ results: SearchResult[], totalResults: number, searchTime: number }`
- Search infrastructure from Story 6.1 handles indexing, relevance, fuzzy matching

**UI/UX Patterns:**
- ShadCN UI components for consistency (Input, Card, Button, Tabs, Alert)
- Mobile-first responsive design (320px to 2560px)
- Autocomplete debounce: 300ms (balance responsiveness vs API load)
- Result limit: 20 per page (pagination) or 20 per fetch (infinite scroll)

**Performance Considerations:**
- Search API already optimized (<300ms per NFR009 from Story 6.1)
- Client-side debouncing reduces autocomplete API calls
- Image optimization with Next.js Image component
- Skeleton loaders prevent layout shift during loading
