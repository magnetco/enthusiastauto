# Story 9.1: Navigation Completeness & User Account Links

Status: Done

## Story

As a **site visitor or authenticated user**,
I want **all existing pages to be accessible through navigation menus**,
so that **I can easily discover and navigate to key features like Services, Profile, and Garage without needing direct URLs**.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Services Link in Navbar** - Main navigation includes "Services" link between "Parts" and "About" that routes to `/services` page
2. **Profile Link in User Dropdown** - Authenticated users see "Profile" menu item in user dropdown that routes to `/account/profile`
3. **Garage Link in User Dropdown** - Authenticated users see "Garage" menu item in user dropdown that routes to `/account/garage`
4. **Dashboard Link Removed** - Remove non-existent "Dashboard" link from user dropdown menu (page doesn't exist)
5. **Mobile Menu Parity** - Mobile menu includes Services link in main menu list
6. **Consistent Ordering** - User dropdown menu order: Profile → Garage → Account Settings → [Separator] → Sign Out

  - [x] Use existing NavLink component: `<NavLink href="/services">Services</NavLink>`
  - [x] Verify link styling matches existing navbar items (font, hover state, spacing)
  - [x] Test active state highlighting when on `/services` page

- [x] **Task 2: Update UserMenu dropdown with Profile and Garage links** (AC: #2, #3, #4, #6)
  - [x] Open `components/shared/UserMenu.tsx`

    - [x] Verify Services link active state on services page
    - [x] Verify navbar responsive behavior at breakpoints
  - [x] Test user dropdown menu (authenticated):
    - [x] Click Profile → verify navigates to `/account/profile`
    - [x] Click Garage → verify navigates to `/account/garage`
    - [x] Click Account Settings → verify navigates to `/account`
    - [x] Verify Dashboard link is removed (no 404 risk)
    - [x] Verify Sign Out functionality still works
  - [x] Test mobile menu:
    - [x] Open mobile menu → verify Services appears
    - [x] Click Services → verify navigation works
    - [x] Verify menu closes after navigation
  - [x] Test unauthenticated state:
    - [x] Verify "Sign In" link displays instead of user dropdown
    - [x] Verify Services link works for non-authenticated users

- [x] **Task 5: Visual regression checks** (AC: All)
  - [x] Desktop navbar: Verify Services doesn't cause layout shift or overflow
  - [x] User dropdown: Verify menu width accommodates new items
  - [x] Mobile menu: Verify Services link renders correctly in mobile layout
  - [x] Test dark mode: Verify all new links have proper dark mode styling
  - [x] Verify hover/focus states match existing navigation patterns

- [x] **Task 6: Update tests (if navigation tests exist)** (AC: All)
  - [x] Search for existing Navigation or UserMenu test files
  - [x] Update tests to verify Services link presence
  - [x] Update tests to verify Profile and Garage links in user dropdown
  - [x] Update tests to verify Dashboard link is NOT present
  - [x] If no tests exist, document that testing is manual for this story

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

**Navigation Audit Findings:**
- Services page exists at `/app/services/page.tsx` but is not linked anywhere
- Profile page exists at `/app/account/profile/page.tsx` but is not linked in user menu
- Garage page exists at `/app/account/garage/page.tsx` but is not linked in user menu
- Dashboard link in UserMenu points to `/dashboard` which does NOT exist (404 risk)

**Navigation Components Structure:**
```
components/shared/
├── Navigation.tsx       # Main navbar component (Server Component)
├── UserMenu.tsx         # User account dropdown (Client Component)
├── MobileMenu.tsx       # Mobile hamburger menu (Client Component)
└── NavLink.tsx          # Shared navigation link component
```

**Current Desktop Navbar Order:**
Vehicles → Parts → About → Contact → [Shopify menu items]

**New Desktop Navbar Order:**
Vehicles → Parts → **Services** → About → Contact → [Shopify menu items]

**Current User Dropdown Order:**
Account Settings → Dashboard → Sign Out

**New User Dropdown Order:**
**Profile** → **Garage** → Account Settings → Sign Out

### Project Structure Notes

**Files to Modify:**
```
components/shared/
├── Navigation.tsx       # Add Services link to desktop navbar (line ~42-52)
├── UserMenu.tsx         # Add Profile/Garage, remove Dashboard (line ~84-101)
└── MobileMenu.tsx       # Verify Services in mobile menu (line ~79-94)
```

**No New Files Required** - This is purely modification work

**No Dependencies Required** - All components and patterns already exist

### Technical Considerations

**1. Services Link Placement:**
- Insert between Parts and About for logical grouping
- Use existing `<NavLink>` component for consistency
- NavLink handles active state and styling automatically

**2. User Dropdown Changes:**
- Use existing `DropdownMenuItem` with `asChild` pattern
- Follow existing Link wrapping pattern: `<DropdownMenuItem asChild><Link href="...">Text</Link></DropdownMenuItem>`
- Maintain existing cursor-pointer and hover styles

**3. Mobile Menu:**
- Mobile menu renders items from Shopify `menu` prop
- May need to add Services as hardcoded item (similar to desktop approach)
- Verify mobile menu items are not filtered out by Shopify menu logic

**4. No Breaking Changes:**
- Adding links does not break existing functionality
- Removing Dashboard prevents 404 errors (improvement)
- All changes are purely additive or corrective

### Testing Standards

**Manual Testing Focus:**
- Navigation links route correctly
- Active states highlight properly
- Mobile menu behavior unchanged
- User authentication states (logged in vs logged out)
- Dark mode styling consistency

**No Automated Tests Required** (unless existing test suite needs updates)
