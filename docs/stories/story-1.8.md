# Story 1.8: Visual Fitment Compatibility Indicators

Status: Done

## Story

As a user with a selected vehicle,
I want to see clear visual indicators showing which products are compatible,
so that I can quickly identify suitable parts without reading detailed specifications.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Compatible products show green checkmark badge with "Fits Your [Model]" text
2. Badge appears on product cards in listing view
3. Tooltip on compatible badge explains full compatibility (e.g., "Compatible with X4 2022")
4. Universal fit products (no fitment data) show "Check Fitment" warning badge in yellow
5. Products without fitment data display warning icon with tooltip explaining to verify compatibility
6. Consistent badge design using ShadCN Badge component across all views
7. Badges meet WCAG AA accessibility standards (don't rely on color alone - use icons + text)

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Create FitmentBadge component with variants (AC: #1, #4, #5, #6, #7)

  - [x] Subtask 1.1: Create components/FitmentBadge.tsx with TypeScript types

  - [x] Subtask 3.5: Display "check-fitment" variant when fitmentStatus === "universal"
  - [x] Subtask 3.6: Do not display badge when fitmentStatus === "incompatible" (product is filtered out)

  - [x] Subtask 5.10: Test dark mode appearance if enabled

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

**Component Structure:**

- `/components/FitmentBadge.tsx` - NEW: Badge component with 3 variants (compatible, check-fitment, universal)
- `/components/ui/tooltip.tsx` - EXISTING: ShadCN Tooltip component (installed during Story 1.2)
- `/components/product-card.tsx` - UPDATE: Add FitmentBadge display based on vehicle selection
- `/lib/utils/vehicle.ts` - EXISTING: Contains matchVehicle function that returns fitment status

**FitmentBadge Props Interface:**

```typescript
export interface FitmentBadgeProps {
  variant: "compatible" | "check-fitment" | "universal";
  modelName?: string; // e.g., "X4" - for compatible variant
  year?: number; // e.g., 2022 - for compatible variant tooltip
}
```

**Fitment Status Logic:**

```typescript
const fitmentStatus = matchVehicle(product, filters.vehicle);
// Returns: "compatible" | "universal" | "incompatible"

const showFitmentBadge = filters.vehicle !== null;
// Only show badges when user has selected a vehicle
```

**Badge Variants:**

1. **Compatible** (Green with checkmark):

   - Badge text: "Fits Your [Model]" (e.g., "Fits Your X4")
   - Icon: Check (Lucide React)
   - Tooltip: "Compatible with [Model] [Year]" (e.g., "Compatible with X4 2022")
   - Color: bg-green-600 text-white

2. **Check Fitment** (Yellow with warning):

   - Badge text: "Check Fitment"
   - Icon: AlertCircle (Lucide React)
   - Tooltip: "No fitment data available. Please verify compatibility before purchasing."
   - Color: bg-yellow-100 text-yellow-800 (light mode), dark:bg-yellow-900/30 dark:text-yellow-500 (dark mode)

3. **Universal** (Gray, no tooltip):
   - Badge text: "Universal Fit"
   - No icon
   - No tooltip needed
   - Color: bg-neutral-500 text-white

**Integration Flow:**

```
User selects vehicle (X4 2022) → FilterContext updates
→ ProductCard calls matchVehicle(product, filters.vehicle)
→ FitmentBadge displays with appropriate variant
→ User hovers/focuses on badge → Tooltip shows additional info
```

### Project Structure Notes

**File Locations:**

- FitmentBadge: `components/FitmentBadge.tsx` (new component)
- ProductCard update: `components/product-card.tsx` (existing, add badge display)
- Tooltip component: `components/ui/tooltip.tsx` (existing from Story 1.2)
- Vehicle matching utility: `lib/utils/vehicle.ts` (existing from Story 1.2)

**Dependencies:**

- ShadCN Badge component: Already installed
- ShadCN Tooltip component: Installed via `npx shadcn@latest add tooltip` (Story 1.2)
- Lucide React icons: Already installed (Check, AlertCircle)
- matchVehicle function: Available from lib/utils/vehicle.ts (Story 1.2)

**Existing Patterns (from Story 1.2):**

- Vehicle selection stored in FilterContext (filters.vehicle)
- matchVehicle utility returns fitment status: "compatible" | "universal" | "incompatible"
- ProductCard already imports useFilters hook
- Color scheme follows UX spec Section 5.1 (success-green #22c55e)

**No Conflicts:**

- Story 1.2 created the infrastructure (vehicle selection, matching logic)
- Story 1.8 adds the visual layer (badges, tooltips) on top of that infrastructure
- Both stories work together seamlessly
