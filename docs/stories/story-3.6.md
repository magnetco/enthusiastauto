## Dev Notes

- Relevant architecture patterns and constraints
- Source tree components to touch
- Testing standards summary

### Architecture Context

**From solution-architecture.md:**

- **Sanity Studio Configuration**: Located at `sanity/` directory with `sanity.config.ts` as main config file
- **Custom Desk Structure**: Use `deskStructure` option to create custom document groupings and views
- **Document Templates**: Defined via `initialValueTemplates` in Sanity config
- **Preview Configuration**: Configure preview URLs in `sanity.config.ts` using `productionUrl` setting
- **Authentication**: Sanity Studio uses Google OAuth for editor authentication
- **CMS Access**: Studio deployed to Sanity's hosted platform (sanity.studio) OR embedded at /studio route

**Validation Strategy**: Use Sanity's built-in validation API in schema definitions (e.g., `validation: Rule => Rule.required()`)

**Preview Integration**: Configure preview URLs pointing to Next.js route with draft mode enabled (e.g., `/api/preview?secret=...&slug=...`)

### Project Structure Notes

**Sanity Studio Files**:
```
sanity/
  ├── schemas/
  │   └── vehicle.ts (existing vehicle schema)
  ├── lib/
  │   ├── desk/
  │   │   └── structure.ts (NEW - custom desk structure)
  │   └── templates/
  │       └── vehicles.ts (NEW - document templates)
  ├── static/ (NEW - custom branding assets)
  │   └── logo.png
  └── sanity.config.ts (UPDATE - desk structure, templates, preview config)
```

**Next.js Preview API**:
```
app/api/
  ├── preview/
  │   └── route.ts (NEW - draft mode preview endpoint)
  └── disable-preview/
      └── route.ts (NEW - exit preview mode)
```

**Training Documentation**:
```
docs/
  └── sanity-editor-guide.md (NEW - comprehensive editor training doc)
```

### Component Implementation Notes

1. **Custom Desk Structure** - Use Sanity's `deskStructure` builder to create:
   - "Current Vehicles" filter (status: "Current")
   - "Sold Vehicles" filter (status: "Sold")
   - "Drafts" filter (_id.startsWith("drafts."))
   - Sort by: newest first (_createdAt desc)

2. **Document Templates** - Create initial value templates for:
   - Standard Vehicle (sets make: "BMW", status: "Current")
   - Sold Vehicle (sets status: "Sold", disables certain fields)
   - Provide template picker when creating new document

3. **Bulk Upload** - Sanity's default image asset source supports:
   - Drag-and-drop multiple files
   - Progress indicators built-in
   - Auto-generation of thumbnails
   - Optimal formats: JPEG for photos (max 2MB each), PNG for logos

4. **Field Validation** - Add validation rules in vehicle schema:
   - Required: title, year, make, model, price, status, slug
   - Year: `Rule.min(1900).max(new Date().getFullYear() + 1)`
   - Price: `Rule.min(0)`
   - Slug: `Rule.required().custom((slug) => isUnique(slug))`

5. **Preview Configuration** - Set up in sanity.config.ts:
```typescript
preview: {
  select: {
    title: 'title',
    media: 'heroImage'
  },
  prepare(selection) {
    const {title, media} = selection
    return {
      title,
      media,
      subtitle: 'Vehicle'
    }
  }
}
```

6. **Training Documentation** - Create comprehensive guide covering:
   - Studio login and navigation
   - Creating new vehicles (with screenshots)
   - Image upload best practices
   - SEO field optimization
   - Draft/publish workflow
   - Common troubleshooting

### Testing Strategy

**Manual Testing**:
- [ ] Verify custom desk structure displays correct groupings
- [ ] Test document template creation for all vehicle types
- [ ] Upload 20-30 images in bulk, verify performance
- [ ] Test field validation prevents publishing invalid data
- [ ] Verify preview functionality shows draft content
- [ ] Conduct training session with 2-3 editors, gather feedback

**Acceptance Validation**:
- [ ] Non-technical editor can create complete vehicle listing in <15 minutes
- [ ] Bulk upload of 30 images completes successfully
- [ ] Validation prevents publishing vehicles without required fields
- [ ] Preview shows accurate draft content before publishing
- [ ] Training documentation is clear and comprehensive
- [ ] Editors report confidence in using Studio independently
