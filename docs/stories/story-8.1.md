# Story 8.1: Sanity CMS Schema for Events

Status: Ready

## Story

As a **content editor**,
I want **a comprehensive Sanity CMS schema for managing event listings**,
so that **I can create, manage, and publish events with status tracking, photo galleries, and all necessary metadata**.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Event Document Schema Created** - Sanity schema includes all required fields: title, slug, eventDate, location, status (upcoming/recap/past), hero image, photo gallery, description, external website link, and SEO metadata
2. **Status Management** - Status field supports three states: "upcoming" (future events), "recap" (past events with photos/summary), and "past" (archived events)
3. **Date and Location Fields** - EventDate field with proper date validation, location field with venue name and address support
4. **Photo Gallery Support** - Images array field supporting 1-20 high-quality event photos with captions and hotspot support for cropping
5. **Rich Text Description** - Description field using Sanity's portable text editor for rich content formatting
6. **SEO Metadata Fields** - Meta title, meta description, and Open Graph image fields for social sharing optimization
7. **External Links** - Optional external website URL field for linking to third-party event pages (Cars & Bids, Bring a Trailer, etc.)
8. **Studio Preview Configuration** - Custom preview showing event title, date, status badge, and hero image in Sanity Studio list view
9. **Field Validation** - Validation rules ensure required fields (title, slug, eventDate, status, hero image) are completed before publishing
10. **Schema Registration** - Event schema properly registered in Sanity config and appears in Studio navigation

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Patterns

**Sanity CMS Schema Pattern:** Follow the established vehicle schema pattern from Epic 3 (Story 3.2):
- Document-type schema with TypeScript definition
- Field validation using Sanity's Rule API
- Custom preview configuration for Studio list views
- Image fields with hotspot support for flexible cropping
- Portable text for rich content editing

**Schema Location:** `sanity/schemas/event.ts`

**Registration:** Schema must be imported and registered in `sanity/schemas/index.ts` to appear in Studio

**Status Field Design:**
- **upcoming**: Events with future dates, displayed on /events page
- **recap**: Past events with photos/content, featured on /events page
- **past**: Archived events, optionally hidden from main listings

**Image Requirements:**
- Hero image: Required, minimum 1200x630px for social sharing
- Gallery images: Optional 1-20 images, recommended 1920x1080px
- All images support hotspot for focal point selection

### Project Structure Notes

**Sanity Schema Files:**
```
sanity/
â”œâ”€â”€ schemas/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts          # Schema registration
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ vehicle.ts        # Existing vehicle schema (reference)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ event.ts          # New event schema (this story)
â”œâ”€â”€ lib/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ client.ts         # Sanity client configuration
â””â”€â”€ sanity.config.ts      # Studio configuration
```

**Studio Desk Structure:**
```
Sanity Studio Navigation
â”œâ”€â”€ Vehicles (existing)
â”œâ”€â”€ Events (new)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Upcoming Events
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Past Events (Recaps)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Archived Events
â””â”€â”€ Settings
```

**Technical Decisions:**
- **Status Field**: Three-state status (upcoming/recap/past) supports both future event promotion and past event archival with photo recaps
- **Calendar Fields**: Start time, end time, and timezone fields included in schema to support .ics generation in Story 8.4
- **External URL**: Optional field allows linking to third-party event pages (Cars & Bids, Bring a Trailer) while maintaining Enthusiast Auto event presence
- **SEO First**: Dedicated meta fields ensure optimal social sharing and search engine visibility

**Dependencies:**
- Sanity CMS infrastructure from Epic 3 (Stories 3.1-3.2) must be complete
- No new packages required - uses existing @sanity/vision, @sanity/client, sanity packages
- TypeScript types will auto-generate from schema via `sanity schema extract`

**Testing Standards:**
- All required fields must be validated with Sanity Rule API
- Sample event creation must succeed with all field types
- Studio preview must render correctly with status badges
- Schema must extract valid TypeScript types
