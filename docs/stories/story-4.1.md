# Story 4.1: Unified Navigation Header

Status: Done

## Story

As a user,
I want consistent navigation that works across vehicles and parts sections,
so that I can easily switch between browsing vehicles and shopping for parts.

## Acceptance Criteria

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Patterns and Constraints

**Navigation Architecture (Source: docs/solution-architecture.md#2.3):**
- Navigation component should be shared across all pages via root layout
- Use Next.js Link with active state detection (usePathname hook)
- Server-rendered for SEO (Navigation component can be Server Component, but needs Client Component for interactive parts)
- Sticky header with z-50 to stay above content

**Rendering Strategy:**
- Navigation Header: Server Component (static parts) + Client Components (mobile menu, user menu)
- Root layout wraps all pages, ensuring navigation appears consistently

**Component Consolidation:**
- Existing components to consolidate: `components/layout/bmw-navigation.tsx`, `components/layout/desktop-navbar.tsx`, `components/layout/expanded-navbar.tsx`
- New location: `components/shared/Navigation.tsx` per architecture (Source: docs/solution-architecture.md#11.3)

**Mobile Navigation:**
- Use HeadlessUI Dialog for mobile menu drawer (proven in Phase 1 with FilterDrawer)
- Hamburger menu visible only below md breakpoint (Tailwind `md:hidden`)
- Full navigation links visible above md breakpoint (`hidden md:flex`)

**Active State Detection:**
```typescript
'use client';
import { usePathname } from 'next/navigation';

const pathname = usePathname();
const isActive = pathname.startsWith('/vehicles'); // For /vehicles link
```

**Integration Points:**
- Search bar placeholder for Epic 6 (UnifiedSearchBar component)
- User menu placeholder for Epic 5 (NextAuth session integration)
- Cart icon from Phase 1 (CartContext should already exist)

### Source Tree Components to Touch

**Files to Create:**
- `components/shared/Navigation.tsx` - Main unified navigation component
- `components/shared/MobileMenu.tsx` - Mobile hamburger menu (client component)
- `components/shared/SearchBar.tsx` - Placeholder search component (Epic 6 will enhance)
- `components/shared/UserMenu.tsx` - Placeholder user menu (Epic 5 will enhance)

**Files to Modify:**
- `app/layout.tsx` - Add Navigation component to root layout
- `components/layout/bmw-navigation.tsx` - Deprecate or consolidate into Navigation.tsx
- `components/layout/desktop-navbar.tsx` - Deprecate or consolidate into Navigation.tsx
- `components/layout/expanded-navbar.tsx` - Deprecate or consolidate into Navigation.tsx

**Files to Reference:**
- `components/ui/button.tsx` - ShadCN Button for hamburger and CTAs
- `components/ui/dialog.tsx` or `components/ui/sheet.tsx` - For mobile menu
- `components/layout/cart/modal.tsx` - Existing cart functionality
- `components/shared/Logo.tsx` - If exists, reuse; otherwise create

### Testing Standards Summary

**Unit Testing (Vitest):**
- Test Navigation component renders all links
- Test active state detection with mock usePathname
- Test mobile menu open/close functionality
- Test responsive visibility (hamburger hidden on desktop, nav links hidden on mobile)

**E2E Testing (Playwright):**
- Navigate between /vehicles, /products, / routes and verify active state updates
- Click hamburger menu on mobile viewport and verify drawer opens
- Test cart icon click navigates to cart
- Test keyboard navigation (Tab through links, Enter to activate)

**Accessibility Testing:**
- Run axe-core on Navigation component
- Verify all links have accessible labels
- Check focus indicators are visible (2px brand-blue ring per architecture)
- Test screen reader announcements for active page

**Visual Regression:**
- Screenshot Navigation on mobile, tablet, desktop viewports
- Verify consistent styling across all breakpoints

### Project Structure Notes

**Alignment with Unified Project Structure:**
- Navigation.tsx belongs in `components/shared/` per architecture (Source: docs/solution-architecture.md#11.2)
- Mobile-specific components (MobileMenu) can be co-located with Navigation or in `components/shared/`
- Root layout modification aligns with monolithic Next.js structure

**Naming Conventions:**
- Use PascalCase for component files: `Navigation.tsx`, `MobileMenu.tsx`
- Use camelCase for utility functions: `getActiveState()`
- Follow ShadCN naming for UI components: `button.tsx`, `dialog.tsx`

**Detected Conflicts:**
- Multiple existing navbar components (bmw-navigation, desktop-navbar, expanded-navbar) should be consolidated
- Rationale: Single Navigation component simplifies maintenance and ensures consistency across unified platform

<!-- Path(s) to story context XML will be added here by context workflow -->

### Agent Model Used

Claude Sonnet 4.5 (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)

### Debug Log References

**Implementation Plan (2025-10-22):**
1. Analyzed existing navigation components (bmw-navigation.tsx, desktop-navbar.tsx, expanded-navbar.tsx) from Phase 1
2. Created new unified Navigation component at `components/shared/Navigation.tsx` per architecture spec
3. Implemented active state detection using Next.js `usePathname()` hook in client component NavLink
4. Re-used existing MobileMenu pattern with HeadlessUI Dialog for mobile navigation
5. Integrated existing SearchBar and CartModal components
6. Created UserMenu placeholder component for Epic 5 authentication
7. Updated root layout.tsx to use new Navigation component
8. All acceptance criteria met through implementation

**Technical Decisions:**
- Used composition pattern: Server Component (Navigation) + Client Components (NavLink, MobileMenu, UserMenu)
- Kept existing search functionality intact by re-exporting from components/layout/navbar/search
- Active state uses underline decoration for accessibility and visual clarity
- Mobile menu uses HeadlessUI Dialog (proven pattern from existing FilterDrawer)

### Completion Notes

**Completed:** 2025-10-22
**Definition of Done:** All acceptance criteria met, code reviewed, tests passing, deployed

### Completion Notes List

**Story 4.1 Implementation Complete:**

All 8 tasks and 40+ subtasks completed successfully. Unified navigation header now provides consistent navigation across vehicles and parts sections with the following features:

2. **Active State:** Current section highlighted with underline decoration using `usePathname()`
3. **Mobile Menu:** Hamburger menu with HeadlessUI Dialog, accessible on <md breakpoints
4. **Search Integration:** Existing search bar integrated and accessible from header
5. **Cart Visibility:** Cart icon with count badge visible across all pages
6. **User Menu:** "Sign In" link placeholder for Epic 5 authentication
7. **Responsive Design:** Mobile (<md), tablet (md-lg), desktop (â‰¥lg) breakpoints handled
8. **Client-side Routing:** Navigation state persists with Next.js Link, no full page reloads

**Build Status:** âœ… Production build successful (pnpm build)
