## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

**Rendering Strategy:**
- **ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)** with 60-second revalidation per solution-architecture.md §2.2 (lines 129-209)
- **generateStaticParams** pre-renders top 50 current vehicles at build time for instant first-load performance
- **On-demand generation** for vehicles not in top 50 (generated on first request, then cached)
- **Webhook revalidation** (Story 3.5) will trigger immediate updates when vehicle status changes

**Component Architecture:**
- **Server Components** for page route (app/vehicles/[slug]/page.tsx) - fetches data, generates metadata
- **Client Components** for interactive elements (VehicleGallery, ContactInquiry) - marked with 'use client'
- **Shared Components** for reusable UI (Breadcrumb, Badge, Dialog) from components/shared or components/ui

**Data Fetching:**
- Use Sanity client with vehicleDetailQuery GROQ query
- Query includes: all vehicle fields, full images array with asset metadata, specifications, features, description (portable text), service history
- Handle 404s gracefully with Next.js notFound() function

**Image Optimization:**
- Sanity CDN provides optimized images with LQIP metadata
- Next.js Image component handles responsive sizing and lazy loading
- Priority loading for hero image (first in gallery)
- Lazy loading for thumbnails and images below the fold

**SEO Strategy:**
- Schema.org Vehicle structured data for rich snippets in Google search results
- Dynamic metadata generation respects custom seo.metaTitle/metaDescription from Sanity
- Open Graph and Twitter Cards enable rich social sharing
- Breadcrumb structured data improves search result display

### Project Structure Notes

**File Organization:**
```
app/vehicles/[slug]/
  └── page.tsx              # Server Component route

components/vehicles/
  ├── VehicleGallery.tsx    # Client Component (photo gallery)
  ├── VehicleSpecs.tsx      # Specs display component
  ├── VehicleDescription.tsx # Portable text renderer
  └── ServiceHistory.tsx    # Service records display

components/shared/
  ├── Breadcrumb.tsx        # Breadcrumb navigation
  └── ContactInquiry.tsx    # Contact button/modal

lib/sanity/
  └── queries.ts            # Add vehicleDetailQuery (GROQ)
```

**Alignment with Tech Spec:**
- Implementation follows tech spec epic-3-vehicle-inventory-tech-spec.md Story 3.4 section (lines 1003-1393)
- Uses exact component structure and GROQ queries from tech spec
- Follows established Sanity client patterns from Story 3.1

**Detected Variances:**
- **Gallery Library:** Tech spec shows custom implementation; we may use ShadCN Dialog instead of custom fullscreen implementation (simpler, more maintainable)
- **Contact Form:** Tech spec shows ContactInquiry component; actual implementation may be contact page link vs modal (TBD based on Epic 4 unified architecture)

**UX Specification:**
- Expected UX patterns for vehicle detail pages (if ux-specification.md includes vehicle pages)

- Image gallery components from Phase 1 (components/product/gallery.tsx) - reference for carousel/thumbnail patterns
- Breadcrumb implementation from Story 1.5 if exists

### Testing Strategy

**Manual Testing:**
1. Navigate to /vehicles from homepage
2. Click into a vehicle listing
3. Verify all vehicle information displays correctly
4. Test photo gallery: click through all images, thumbnails, fullscreen mode
5. Test breadcrumb navigation (click Home, Vehicles)
6. Click "Contact Us" button, verify subject pre-fills
7. Test with sold vehicle: verify SOLD badge, disabled contact button
8. Test responsive layout on mobile, tablet, desktop
9. Verify page loads in <2 seconds
10. Test keyboard navigation in gallery (arrow keys, escape)

**Automated Testing:**
```typescript
// __tests__/vehicles/[slug]/page.test.tsx
describe('Vehicle Detail Page', () => {
  it('should render vehicle title and price', async () => {
    const mockVehicle = { title: '2005 BMW E46 M3', price: 35000 };
    render(<VehicleDetailPage vehicle={mockVehicle} />);
    expect(screen.getByText('2005 BMW E46 M3')).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(screen.getByText('$35,000')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it('should display SOLD badge for sold vehicles', () => {
    const soldVehicle = { status: 'sold', title: 'Sold Car' };
    render(<VehicleDetailPage vehicle={soldVehicle} />);
    expect(screen.getByText('SOLD')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it('should disable contact button for sold vehicles', () => {
    const soldVehicle = { status: 'sold' };
    render(<VehicleDetailPage vehicle={soldVehicle} />);
    expect(screen.queryByText('Inquire About This Vehicle')).not.toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});

// __tests__/components/VehicleGallery.test.tsx
describe('VehicleGallery', () => {
  it('should navigate between images with arrow buttons', () => {
    const images = [{ asset: { url: 'img1.jpg' } }, { asset: { url: 'img2.jpg' } }];
    render(<VehicleGallery images={images} />);

    const nextButton = screen.getByLabelText('Next image');
    fireEvent.click(nextButton);

    expect(screen.getByAltText(/image 2/i)).toBeVisible();
  });

  it('should open fullscreen on expand button click', () => {
    render(<VehicleGallery images={mockImages} />);
    fireEvent.click(screen.getByLabelText('Fullscreen'));
    expect(screen.getByRole('dialog')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

**SEO Validation:**
- Run Google Rich Results Test: https://search.google.com/test/rich-results
- Validate schema.org Vehicle markup
- Check Open Graph with Facebook Sharing Debugger
- Verify Twitter Card preview
- Test breadcrumb structured data

**Performance Testing:**
- Run Lighthouse audit in Chrome DevTools
- Target scores: Performance 85+, SEO 95+, Accessibility 95+
- Measure Time to First Byte (TTFB) <500ms
- Measure Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) <2.5s
- Verify Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) <0.1

**Build Validation:**
```bash
# TypeScript compilation
pnpm build

# Should output:
# - Route (app)                              Type     Size
# - ○ /vehicles/[slug]                       Static   XXkB (ISR: 60s)

# Verify ISR configuration shows "Static (ISR: 60s)"
```
