# Story 3.2: Vehicle Schema & Data Models

Status: Done

## Story

As a content editor,
I want comprehensive vehicle schemas in Sanity Studio matching our existing Webflow structure,
so that I can migrate vehicle data and manage inventory in a structured way.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Vehicle schema includes all basic fields matching Webflow: listingTitle, slug, stockNumber (last 7 of VIN), vin, chassis (E39/E46/F30/etc dropdown), mileage, bodyStyle, drive (RWD/AWD)
2. Color and pricing fields: exteriorColor, interiorColor, listingPrice, showCallForPrice toggle, availabilityDate (optional, hides listing if in future)
3. Status and visibility fields: inventoryStatus (Current Inventory/Sold dropdown), statusTag (New Arrival/etc dropdown), isLive toggle, featuredVehicle toggle, featuredInventory toggle
4. Engine and transmission fields: engineCodes (S62/N54/etc dropdown), engineType (Gasoline/Diesel, required for CarsForSale), engineSize (V8 Engine/I6 Engine/etc, required for CarsForSale), transmission (Manual/Automatic, required for CarsForSale)
5. Image fields separated by category: signatureShot (hero for current inventory), soldShot (hero for sold vehicles), secondaryShot, galleryExterior1 (array, ~25 images), galleryExterior2 (array, ~25 images), galleryExterior3 (array), galleryInterior1 (array), galleryInterior2 (array)
6. Content fields: listingThumbnailFeatures (array of strings for bullet points), highlights (rich text), overview (rich text), history (plain text for featured vehicle description)
7. Business fields: sortOrder (number for manual ordering), featuredVehicleThumbnailText (rich text for featured carousel)
8. All CarsForSale required fields properly marked: stockNumber, vin, exteriorColor, interiorColor, mileage, engineType, engineSize, transmission, listingPrice

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Patterns and Constraints

**Sanity Schema Architecture (Webflow Migration):**
- Schema designed to **match existing Webflow CMS structure exactly** for seamless data migration
- Vehicle document type mirrors Webflow collection with identical field names (camelCase conversion)
- **Image organization:** Separate galleries by category (exterior1/2/3, interior1/2) instead of single array - matches Webflow structure and editorial workflow
- **Hero image strategy:** signatureShot (current inventory), soldShot (sold status), secondaryShot (additional hero) - matches Webflow conditional display logic
- **CarsForSale integration:** Required fields marked per CarsForSale feed requirements (stockNumber, vin, colors, mileage, engine specs, transmission, price)

**Data Model Alignment:**
- **inventoryStatus field** (Current Inventory/Sold) drives which hero shot displays (signatureShot vs soldShot)
- **statusTag field** (New Arrival/Reduced Price/etc) shows badge on listing cards separate from inventory status
- **Featured toggles:** featuredVehicle (inventory section), featuredInventory (carousel only), isLive (site visibility) provide granular display control
- **availabilityDate:** Frontend filtering logic needed - if date in future, hide listing (Sanity stores, Next.js filters in GROQ query)
- **showCallForPrice:** Frontend conditional - if true, display "Call For Price" instead of listingPrice value
- **sortOrder:** Manual ordering for featured lists (higher number = higher priority)

**Chassis Code Options (Based on Webflow Screenshot):**
- E39 (M5 1999-2003), E46 (M3 2001-2006), E90/E92 (M3 2008-2013)
- F30/F80 (M3 2014-2018), G80 (M3/M4 2021+)
- X3, X5, etc. (crossovers)
- Additional codes can be added via Sanity Studio

**Engine Code Options (Based on Webflow Screenshot):**
- S62 (E39 M5 V8), S54 (E46 M3 I6), S65 (E90 M3 V8)
- N54/N55 (335i turbo I6), B58 (340i/M240i turbo I6), S58 (G80 M3/M4 turbo I6)
- Additional codes can be added as needed

**Image Optimization Strategy:**
- Sanity image CDN provides automatic optimization (per architecture bandwidth concerns)
- Hotspot feature on all images enables focal point selection for responsive cropping
- Alt text required on all images for WCAG AA accessibility compliance
- Multiple gallery fields support editorial workflow (organize by exterior/interior, limit 25 per gallery for Webflow parity)

**Testing Standards:**
- Manual validation: Create test vehicle matching Webflow example (2003 BMW E39 M5, VIN WBSDE93453CF93682, all fields from screenshots)
- Validation testing: Attempt invalid inputs (short VIN, missing CarsForSale required fields, negative price)
- Image upload testing: Upload to all 5 gallery fields (signatureShot, exterior1/2/3, interior1/2), verify 25-image limits
- Rich text testing: Format highlights and overview with bullets, headings, emphasis
- Toggle testing: Verify isLive/featuredVehicle/featuredInventory/showCallForPrice work correctly
- Preview testing: Confirm document preview shows correct title, price, status, chassis, image

### Source Tree Components

**Files to Create:**
1. `sanity/schemas/vehicle.ts` - Complete vehicle schema definition matching Webflow structure (~700 lines estimated)

**Files to Update:**
2. `sanity/schemas/index.ts` - Add vehicle to schema exports

**Existing Files (No Modification Needed):**
- `sanity/sanity.config.ts` - Already configured per Story 3.1
- `lib/sanity/client.ts` - Sanity client already configured
- `.env.local` - Sanity environment variables already set

**Dependencies (Already Installed - Story 3.1):**
- `@sanity/client@3.62.0` (Note: Installed version may be 4.x based on Story 3.1 implementation)
- `next-sanity@9.12.0`
- `@sanity/cli` (dev dependency)

### Project Structure Notes

**Alignment with Existing Webflow Structure:**
- Field names converted from Webflow to camelCase (e.g., "Listing Title" â†’ listingTitle, "Gallery Exterior 1" â†’ galleryExterior1)
- Dropdown options preserved from Webflow (Current Inventory/Sold, chassis codes, engine codes, etc.)
- Image field organization matches Webflow (separate galleries instead of single array)
- CarsForSale required field indicators preserved in field descriptions

**Data Migration Preparation:**
- Schema design enables CSV import from Webflow export with minimal transformation
- Field mapping documented: Webflow "Listing Title" â†’ Sanity listingTitle, etc.
- Image URLs from Webflow can be imported and uploaded to Sanity asset system
- Rich text content may need transformation from Webflow HTML to Sanity portable text

**No Detected Conflicts:**
- Vehicle schema is new content type - no conflicts with existing Shopify product schemas
- Separate image galleries avoid single-field array limitations
- Chassis/engine code dropdowns extensible for future BMW models

## Dev Agent Record

### Context Reference

- `docs/stories/story-context-3.3.2.xml` (Generated: 2025-10-21)

### Agent Model Used

- Claude Sonnet 4.5 (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)
- Implementation Date: 2025-10-21

### Debug Log References

**Implementation Approach:**
- Created comprehensive vehicle schema in single file matching Webflow structure exactly
- Used Sanity v4 defineType/defineField API (not v3 object syntax from tech spec)
- All 40+ fields implemented in organized sections with clear task comments
- Validation rules configured inline with field definitions
- Preview configuration implemented with formatted subtitle

**Key Technical Decisions:**
1. **Alt Text Validation Pattern**: Used conditional validation for optional image fields (soldShot, secondaryShot) - alt text only required if image asset is provided, preventing validation errors on empty optional fields
2. **Portable Text Configuration**: Configured three distinct portable text field types:
   - `highlights`: Normal style only, bullets/numbered lists, strong/emphasis marks
   - `overview`: H2/H3 headings, bullets/numbered lists, strong/emphasis marks (full content editing)
   - `featuredVehicleThumbnailText`: Normal style only, no lists, strong/emphasis marks (simple formatted text)
3. **Dropdown vs Radio Layout**: inventoryStatus uses radio layout for better UX (only 2 options: Current Inventory/Sold), all other dropdown fields use default dropdown layout
4. **Gallery Organization**: Implemented 5 separate gallery arrays (galleryExterior1/2/3, galleryInterior1/2) with 25-image max validation each, matching Webflow structure for editorial workflow
5. **CarsForSale Integration**: All required fields marked in descriptions for clear content editor guidance

**Build Validation:**
- TypeScript compilation: âœ“ PASSED (no errors)
- Next.js production build: âœ“ PASSED (13 routes generated including /studio)
- Development server: âœ“ RUNNING (port 3002)
