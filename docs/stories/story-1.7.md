# Story 1.7: Responsive Grid Layout Implementation

Status: Done

## Story

As a **user on any device**,
I want **the site to adapt to my screen size**,
so that **I have an optimal browsing experience on mobile, tablet, or desktop**.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Product grid adapts seamlessly across all viewports:

   - **Mobile (< 640px):** 1 column layout with full-width cards
   - **Tablet (640-1023px):** 2-3 columns with appropriate gap spacing
   - **Desktop (1024px+):** 3-4 columns with optimal viewing density

2. All UI elements meet minimum touch target requirements:

   - Minimum **44x44 pixels** for all interactive elements (WCAG 2.1 AA)
   - Buttons, links, form controls, and clickable cards
   - Adequate spacing between touch targets (8px minimum)

3. Navigation adapts to viewport size:

   - **Mobile:** Hamburger menu (â˜°) replaces full navigation bar
   - **Desktop:** Full horizontal navigation visible
   - Smooth transitions between collapsed/expanded states

4. Filters are accessible on all devices:

   - **Mobile:** Slide-out drawer or bottom sheet with "Filters" button
   - **Tablet:** Optional drawer or sidebar toggle
   - **Desktop:** Fixed sidebar always visible (240-280px width)
   - All filter sections functional across viewports

5. Images maintain aspect ratio and quality:

   - Responsive images using Next.js Image component
   - No distortion or stretching at any viewport
   - Proper lazy loading with placeholder skeletons
   - Support for WebP with fallback formats

6. Typography scales appropriately:

   - Readable font sizes at all breakpoints (minimum 16px body text)
   - Proper line heights for readability
   - Headings scale proportionally with `clamp()` or breakpoint-based sizing

7. Site tested across full viewport range:

   - **Minimum:** 320px (iPhone SE)
   - **Maximum:** 2560px (large desktop displays)
   - Key breakpoints: 375px, 640px, 768px, 1024px, 1280px, 1536px

8. No horizontal scrolling on any viewport:
   - Container max-widths prevent overflow
   - All content constrained to viewport width
   - Proper `overflow-x` handling

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

This story focuses on implementing responsive design patterns across the entire application, ensuring optimal user experience on all devices per PRD NFR002. The implementation builds on the existing Next.js 15 + Tailwind CSS 4 foundation.

**Key Architectural Decisions:**

1. **Mobile-First Approach:** Start with mobile layouts (320px) and progressively enhance for larger viewports using `min-width` media queries (Tailwind's `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:` prefixes).

2. **CSS Grid for Product Layout:** Use Tailwind's `grid` utilities with responsive column counts:

   ```tsx
   <div className="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 xl:grid-cols-4 gap-4 md:gap-6">
   ```

3. **Breakpoint System:** Follow UX spec breakpoints:

   - Mobile: `< 640px` (default)
   - Tablet: `640px - 1023px` (sm, md)
   - Desktop: `1024px+` (lg, xl, 2xl)

4. **Touch Target Compliance:** WCAG 2.1 Level AA requires 44x44px minimum for mobile interactions (UX spec 7.2.5).

5. **Server Components for Static Content:** Navigation and filter panel structure can be Server Components, with client-side interactivity for toggles/drawers.

### Source Tree Components to Touch

**Pages:**

- `app/page.tsx` - Homepage product grid (update grid classes)
- `app/search/page.tsx` - Search results grid (apply responsive patterns)
- `app/product/[handle]/page.tsx` - Product detail responsive layout (already has some responsive design, verify compliance)

**Components:**

- `components/grid/product-grid.tsx` - **PRIMARY** - Core grid layout logic
- `components/layout/navbar/index.tsx` - Add hamburger menu for mobile
- `components/FilterPanel.tsx` - Implement responsive drawer/sidebar patterns
- `components/product-card.tsx` - Ensure touch targets meet 44px minimum
- `components/cart/modal.tsx` - Verify responsive cart drawer
- `components/VehicleSelector.tsx` - Ensure mobile-friendly dropdowns

**New Components to Create:**

- `components/layout/mobile-menu.tsx` - Hamburger menu with slide-out drawer (HeadlessUI Dialog)
- `components/layout/filter-drawer.tsx` - Mobile filter drawer (HeadlessUI Dialog)

**Configuration:**

- `tailwind.config.ts` - Verify breakpoints, container max-widths, touch target utilities
- `app/layout.tsx` - Ensure root layout supports responsive meta viewport tag

### Testing Standards Summary

**Responsive Testing:**

1. **Browser DevTools:** Use Chrome/Firefox responsive mode to test all breakpoints
2. **Real Devices:** Test on actual iPhone, Android phone, iPad, desktop browsers
3. **Accessibility:** Lighthouse accessibility audit (target 90+), axe DevTools scan
4. **Performance:** Lighthouse performance (mobile 85+, desktop 90+)
5. **Touch Testing:** Verify all buttons/links work on touchscreen devices
6. **Zoom Testing:** Test 200% browser zoom without horizontal scrolling

**Viewport Test Matrix:**
| Device | Width | Test Focus |
|--------|-------|------------|
| iPhone SE | 320px | Minimum width, touch targets |
| iPhone 12/13 | 390px | Standard mobile, menu |
| iPad Mini | 768px | Tablet breakpoint transition |
| iPad Pro | 1024px | Desktop breakpoint, filters |
| MacBook | 1280px | Standard desktop, 3-col grid |
| iMac | 1920px+ | Large displays, 4-col grid |

### Project Structure Notes

**Alignment with Unified Project Structure:**

- **App Router Pattern:** All pages use Next.js 15 App Router (`app/` directory)
- **Component Organization:** Maintain existing structure:
  - Layout components: `components/layout/`
  - UI primitives: `components/ui/` (ShadCN)
  - Feature components: `components/` root
- **Server/Client Split:** Default to Server Components, add `'use client'` only for interactive mobile menu/drawer components

**Detected Conflicts or Variances:**

- **Existing Template Responsiveness:** The Next.js Commerce template already has some responsive design. This story will **audit and enhance** existing patterns, not rebuild from scratch.
- **FilterPanel Integration:** FilterPanel component (Story 1.3) needs responsive drawer pattern added for mobile.
- **Navigation Bar:** Current navbar may need refactoring to add hamburger menu toggle.
