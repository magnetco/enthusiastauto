## Dev Notes

**Architecture Patterns:**
- **NextAuth Session Integration:** Profile page uses `getServerSession()` to fetch authenticated user data server-side, ensuring user can only access their own profile
- **Protected Route Pattern:** `/account/profile` protected by middleware from Story 5.1, redirects unauthenticated users to signin
- **Shopify Customer API Integration:** Payment methods fetched from Shopify Customer API for users with purchase history, leveraging Shopify's PCI-compliant payment storage
- **Address Storage Strategy:** Addresses stored in Vercel Postgres (User.addresses JSON field or separate Address table), available for future Shopify checkout integration
- **Multi-Auth Support:** Profile adapts UI based on authentication methods (email/password vs OAuth), conditional rendering of password change section
- **Security-First Design:** Password changes require current password verification, account deletion requires explicit confirmation, session invalidation after sensitive operations

**Profile Page Structure (per solution-architecture.md):**
```
/account/profile (Protected Route)
├── Profile Information Section
│   ├── Avatar/Image (editable, upload)
│   ├── Name (editable)
│   ├── Email (read-only)
│   └── Account Created Date (read-only)
├── Change Password Section (conditional: email/password users only)
│   ├── Current Password
│   ├── New Password
│   └── Confirm New Password
├── Addresses Section
│   ├── Address List (display cards)
│   ├── Add New Address (modal form)
│   ├── Edit Address (modal form)
│   └── Delete Address (confirmation dialog)
├── Connected Accounts Section
│   ├── Linked Providers (Google, Facebook)
│   ├── Unlink Account (with validation)
│   └── Link New Account (OAuth flow)
└── Danger Zone Section
    └── Delete Account (confirmation modal)
```

**Note on Payment Methods:**
Payment methods are intentionally NOT managed in this application. Users manage payment information directly through Shopify's secure checkout flow and Shopify account management. This approach:
- Eliminates PCI compliance requirements for our application
- Reduces security surface area and liability
- Leverages Shopify's proven, secure payment infrastructure
- Simplifies development and maintenance

**Database Schema Updates (Prisma):**
```prisma
model User {
  id            String    @id @default(cuid())
  name          String?
  email         String    @unique
  emailVerified DateTime?
  password      String?   // Null for OAuth-only users
  image         String?   // Avatar URL (Vercel Blob or Cloudinary)
  addresses     Json?     // JSON array of address objects (optional: separate Address table)
  accounts      Account[] // Linked OAuth accounts (from Story 5.1)
  sessions      Session[]
  favorites     UserFavorite[]
  createdAt     DateTime  @default(now())
  updatedAt     DateTime  @updatedAt

  @@index([email])
}

// Optional: Separate Address table for better normalization
model Address {
  id         String   @id @default(cuid())
  userId     String
  user       User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  label      String   // "Home", "Work", etc.
  street     String
  city       String
  state      String
  postalCode String
  country    String   @default("USA")
  phone      String?
  isDefault  Boolean  @default(false)
  createdAt  DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt  DateTime @updatedAt

  @@index([userId])
}
```

**API Routes:**
```typescript
// Profile Update
PATCH /api/user/profile
Body: { name?: string, image?: string }
Response: { success: boolean, user: User }

// Password Change
POST /api/user/password
Body: { currentPassword: string, newPassword: string }
Response: { success: boolean }

// Address CRUD
GET    /api/user/addresses -> { addresses: Address[] }
POST   /api/user/addresses -> { address: Address }
PATCH  /api/user/addresses/[id] -> { address: Address }
DELETE /api/user/addresses/[id] -> { success: boolean }

// Account Linking
DELETE /api/user/accounts/[provider] -> { success: boolean }

// Account Deletion
DELETE /api/user/account
Body: { confirmation: string } // Must equal "DELETE"
Response: { success: boolean }
```

**Testing Standards:**
- **Unit Tests:** Profile update logic, password validation, address validation
- **Integration Tests:** Form submissions, API route handlers, database operations
- **Component Tests:** Profile page rendering, form interactions, conditional rendering
- **Security Tests:** Unauthorized access prevention, password verification, session invalidation
- **Accessibility Tests:** Keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, ARIA attributes
- **GDPR Compliance Tests:** Verify account deletion removes all user data from database

**Performance Considerations:**
- **Server-Side Rendering:** Profile page uses Next.js 15 server components for initial render, reduces client-side data fetching
- **Image Optimization:** Avatar uploads resized to 512x512px, stored in Vercel Blob with automatic CDN delivery
- **Shopify API Caching:** Payment methods cached for 5 minutes to reduce API calls
- **Optimistic UI Updates:** Immediate feedback for form submissions while API processes in background
- **Lazy Loading:** Payment methods section lazy-loaded only when user expands section (optional enhancement)

**Security Best Practices:**
- **Authentication Required:** All profile operations require valid NextAuth session
- **Authorization Checks:** API routes verify userId matches session.user.id (prevent profile tampering)
- **Password Verification:** Current password required before changing password (prevent unauthorized changes)
- **Session Invalidation:** Password changes invalidate all sessions (force re-login for security)
- **Confirmation Required:** Account deletion requires typing "DELETE" and checkbox confirmation
- **PCI Compliance:** Payment information never stored in app database (handled by Shopify)
- **Image Upload Security:** File size and format validation, future: virus scanning integration
- **GDPR Compliance:** Account deletion removes all user data (right to deletion)
- **No Sensitive Data Exposure:** API responses never expose passwords, tokens, or full payment details

**Privacy and Compliance:**
- **GDPR Right to Deletion:** Account deletion permanently removes User record and cascades to related data (sessions, favorites, addresses)
- **CCPA Compliance:** User can request data deletion via account deletion feature
- **Privacy Policy Link:** Profile page footer includes link to privacy policy
- **Data Minimization:** Only collect necessary profile data (name, email, avatar, addresses)
- **Transparent Data Usage:** Clear explanations of what data is stored and how it's used

### Project Structure Notes

**Alignment with Unified Project Structure:**
- `app/account/profile/page.tsx` - Profile page (new file, follows /account/* route structure from solution-architecture.md)
- `app/api/user/profile/route.ts` - Profile update API (new file)
- `app/api/user/password/route.ts` - Password change API (new file)
- `app/api/user/addresses/route.ts` - Addresses CRUD API (new file)
- `app/api/user/accounts/[provider]/route.ts` - Account unlinking API (new file)
- `app/api/user/account/route.ts` - Account deletion API (new file)
- `lib/auth/session.ts` - Extend with profile helpers (existing from Story 5.1)
- `components/account/` - New directory for profile-specific components (ProfileForm, AddressCard, etc.)
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Update User model with addresses field (or add Address table)
- Middleware protection already in place from Story 5.1 (`middleware.ts` protects `/account/*`)

**New Dependencies:**
- `@vercel/blob` - Avatar image upload to Vercel Blob storage (optional: use Cloudinary instead)
- `sharp` - Image resize/optimization (optional: use next/image built-in optimization)
- `react-hook-form` - Form state management (likely already installed)
- `zod` - Form validation schemas (likely already installed)

**No Detected Conflicts:**
- Profile page builds on authentication foundation from Story 5.1 (NextAuth, sessions, User model)
- Connected Accounts section reuses Account table and OAuth logic from Story 5.2
- API routes follow existing pattern from Story 5.1 (protected routes, Prisma operations)
- ShadCN components already integrated in Phase 1 and Story 5.1
- Middleware protection already configured in Story 5.1

**Lessons Learned from Previous Stories:**
- From Story 5.1: NextAuth session management, Prisma User model, protected route patterns, form validation
- From Story 5.2: OAuth account linking logic, Account table structure, social auth UI patterns
- From Story 4.4: Server component data fetching, ISR caching strategies
- From all previous stories: TypeScript strict mode compliance, 80%+ test coverage, ShadCN component usage

4. **Address Management (AC4)**: Built AddressManager component with full CRUD operations, modal-based forms using ShadCN Dialog, address validation (required fields, postal code format), "Set as Default" toggle with default badge display, empty state messaging, and addresses stored in User.addresses JSON field.

5. **Connected Accounts (AC5)**: Implemented ConnectedAccounts component displaying linked OAuth providers (Google, Facebook) with provider icons, unlink functionality with safety checks (prevents account lockout), confirmation dialogs, disabled state with tooltips when unlink is not allowed, and empty state for email-only users.

6. **Delete Account (AC6)**: Created DeleteAccount component in Danger Zone section with destructive styling, confirmation modal requiring "DELETE" text input and checkbox acknowledgment, GDPR-compliant account deletion with cascading deletes (sessions, accounts, addresses), immediate sign-out, and redirect to homepage with confirmation message.

7. **Form Validation (AC7)**: Implemented comprehensive form validation using React Hook Form + Zod schemas for all forms, inline error messages with specific validation feedback, success toasts using sonner (auto-dismiss 3s), loading states with disabled buttons, network error handling with user-friendly messages, and ARIA labels for accessibility.

8. **API Integration (AC8)**: Created 5 protected API routes (profile, password, addresses, addresses/[id], accounts/[provider], account) with NextAuth session validation, userId matching enforcement, appropriate HTTP status codes (200, 400, 401, 403, 500), Prisma transactions for critical operations (password change, account deletion), and optimistic UI updates.

9. **Security & Privacy (AC9)**: Enforced authentication requirements via middleware, current password verification for password changes, explicit confirmation for account deletion, session invalidation after password change, GDPR-compliant data deletion (cascading deletes), payment methods delegated to Shopify (zero PCI scope), and no sensitive data exposed in API responses.

**Technical Implementation**:
- Database: Updated Prisma schema with `addresses` JSON field, ran migration successfully
- Components: 5 client components with improved UX (vertical padding, file upload, better messaging)
- Page: Server-rendered profile page with avatar priority logic (custom > OAuth)
- Types: Created lib/profile/types.ts with Zod schemas and TypeScript interfaces
- Tests: Added unit tests for API routes and types (8 tests passing)
- Build: Successful production build with TypeScript strict mode compliance
- Security: All routes protected by middleware, userId validation in all API handlers
- Storage: Vercel Blob integration for avatar uploads (public access, organized in avatars/ folder)
- UX: Vertical padding on cards, file upload with preview, avatar priority, informative notices

**Key Features**:
- Multi-auth support (email/password + OAuth)
- Password strength calculation
- Address default marking
- Account lockout prevention
- GDPR-compliant deletion
- Responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Error handling with user-friendly messages

All 9 tasks (105 subtasks) completed. Build successful. Tests passing (new tests: 8/8 pass). Story ready for review.

## Change Log

| Date | Author | Change Description |
|------|--------|-------------------|
| 2025-10-23 | claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929 | Initial story creation |
| 2025-10-23 | claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929 | Removed AC5 (Manage Saved Payment Methods) - security/PCI compliance decision to delegate all payment management to Shopify. Renumbered remaining ACs (6-10 → 5-9). Removed Task 5 and renumbered tasks accordingly. Updated from 10 to 9 acceptance criteria. |
| 2025-10-23 | claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929 | Implementation complete - All 9 tasks and 105 subtasks completed. Created 16 files: 1 DB migration, 1 types file, 1 profile page, 5 API routes, 5 client components, 3 test files. All acceptance criteria met. Build successful. Tests passing (8/8). Status: Ready for Review. |
| 2025-10-23 | claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929 | UX improvements based on user feedback: (1) Added vertical padding (py-6) to all Card components for better visual spacing. (2) Implemented actual file upload for avatar using Vercel Blob storage (not just URL input) with @vercel/blob package, file validation (JPEG/PNG/WebP, max 5MB), and preview functionality. Created new API route /api/user/avatar for upload handling. (3) Fixed avatar priority logic - custom uploaded avatars now take precedence over OAuth provider avatars (Google/Facebook). Added visual indicator when using OAuth avatar. (4) Fixed Edit Profile button bug - now properly enters edit mode before allowing changes (was immediately triggering PATCH). (5) Improved password change UX - added informative blue notice explaining password changes will sign out all devices. Also improved messaging for OAuth-only users. Files modified: ProfileForm.tsx, ChangePassword.tsx, AddressManager.tsx, ConnectedAccounts.tsx, DeleteAccount.tsx, app/account/profile/page.tsx. New file: app/api/user/avatar/route.ts. Build successful. |
