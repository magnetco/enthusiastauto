# Story 4.3: Routing Architecture & URL Structure

Status: Done

## Story

As a developer,
I want clean, SEO-friendly URL structure,
so that users and search engines can navigate the site intuitively.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. URL structure: /vehicles/*, /parts/*, /search, /account/*
2. Vehicle URLs: /vehicles (listing), /vehicles/[slug] (detail)
3. Parts URLs: /parts (listing), /parts/[category], /product/[handle]
4. Search URL: /search?q=[query]&type=[vehicles|parts|all]
5. Breadcrumbs reflect URL hierarchy on all pages
6. 301 redirects for any legacy URLs from old site
7. Sitemap.xml includes all dynamic routes
8. Canonical URLs configured correctly

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Review and optimize App Router structure (AC: #1, #2, #3)
  - [x] Audit existing app/ directory structure
  - [x] Verify vehicle routes: `app/vehicles/page.tsx`, `app/vehicles/[slug]/page.tsx`
  - [x] Verify product routes: `app/product/[handle]/page.tsx` (existing Phase 1)
  - [x] Create missing routes: `/parts` (if not aliased from products)
  - [x] Add `/search` route for unified search (Epic 6 dependency, create placeholder)
  - [x] Add `/account` protected route structure (Epic 5 dependency, create placeholder)
  - [x] Document route mapping in code comments

- [x] Task 2: Implement breadcrumb navigation component (AC: #5)
  - [x] Create `components/shared/Breadcrumbs.tsx` component
  - [x] Generate breadcrumb data from current route path using `usePathname()`
  - [x] Format breadcrumbs: Home > Vehicles > [Vehicle Title]
  - [x] Add schema.org BreadcrumbList structured data for SEO
  - [x] Style breadcrumbs with ShadCN design system (text-sm, text-muted-foreground)
  - [x] Integrate breadcrumbs into page layouts (above H1 heading)
  - [x] Test breadcrumbs on all page types (home, listing, detail)

- [x] Task 3: Configure 301 redirects for legacy URLs (AC: #6)
  - [x] Document legacy URL patterns from old enthusiastauto.com site
  - [x] Create redirects in `next.config.ts` using `redirects()` function
  - [x] Add redirects for common patterns:
    - Old vehicle URLs → /vehicles/[slug]
    - Old product URLs → /product/[handle]
  - [x] Test redirects return 301 status code (not 302)
  - [x] Verify SEO: search engines follow 301 redirects properly

- [x] Task 4: Generate dynamic sitemap.xml (AC: #7)
  - [x] Create `app/sitemap.ts` using Next.js 15 sitemap generation
  - [x] Fetch all vehicle slugs from Sanity CMS
  - [x] Fetch all product handles from Shopify API
  - [x] Generate sitemap entries with:
    - URL
    - lastModified date
    - changeFrequency (vehicles: daily, products: weekly)
    - priority (homepage: 1.0, listings: 0.9, details: 0.7)
  - [x] Test sitemap accessible at `/sitemap.xml`
  - [x] Verify sitemap validates at https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/validate-xml-sitemap.html

- [x] Task 5: Configure canonical URLs and metadata (AC: #8)
  - [x] Add canonical URL to metadata in each page type
  - [x] Vehicle pages: canonical = `https://shop.enthusiastauto.com/vehicles/[slug]`
  - [x] Product pages: canonical = `https://shop.enthusiastauto.com/product/[handle]`
  - [x] Use Next.js 15 metadata API (`generateMetadata` function)
  - [x] Ensure no duplicate content issues (avoid query param variations)
  - [x] Add Open Graph and Twitter Card URLs matching canonical
  - [x] Test canonical URLs render correctly in page `<head>`

- [x] Task 6: Implement proper metadata for route segments (AC: #8)
  - [x] Add metadata to layout files: `app/vehicles/layout.tsx`, `app/product/layout.tsx`
  - [x] Define default metadata: title templates, descriptions, og:image
  - [x] Override metadata in page files with specific content
  - [x] Ensure metadata hierarchy works correctly (layout → page)
  - [x] Test metadata with SEO tools (Google Search Console, Lighthouse)

- [x] Task 7: Test and validate routing architecture
  - [x] Verify all routes are accessible and render correctly
  - [x] Test deep linking: direct URL access works without errors
  - [x] Test client-side navigation: Next.js Link preserves state
  - [x] Run Lighthouse SEO audit on all page types (target: 95+ score)
  - [x] Check sitemap includes all pages (vehicles, products, static pages)
  - [x] Verify breadcrumbs render correctly on all pages
  - [x] Test 301 redirects work for legacy URLs

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Patterns and Constraints

**Route Structure (Source: docs/solution-architecture.md#2.3):**
```
/                           # Homepage (ISR) - Featured vehicles + parts
├── /vehicles               # Vehicle listing (ISR, 60s)
│   ├── /[slug]            # Vehicle detail (ISR, 60s + webhook)
│   └── /filter            # Client-side filtered results
├── /products              # Product listing (SSG) - existing Phase 1
│   ├── /[handle]          # Product detail (SSG + ISR)
│   ├── /search            # Search results (Client)
│   └── /compare           # Product comparison (Client)
├── /search                # Unified search (Client + SSR hybrid)
├── /dashboard             # User dashboard (SSR, protected)
│   ├── /profile           # User profile (SSR)
│   ├── /garage            # My Garage favorites (SSR)
│   └── /orders            # Order history (SSR, Shopify integration)
└── /api                   # API routes
```

**Current App Directory Structure:**
```
app/
├── layout.tsx              # Root layout (existing)
├── page.tsx                # Homepage (Story 4.2 ✓)
├── vehicles/               # Epic 3 routes (existing)
│   ├── page.tsx
│   └── [slug]/page.tsx
├── product/[handle]/       # Phase 1 routes (existing)
│   └── page.tsx
├── search/[collection]/    # Phase 1 search (existing)
│   └── page.tsx
└── api/                    # API routes
```

**Missing Routes to Create (Placeholders for Future Epics):**
- `/search` - Unified search (Epic 6 - create placeholder page)
- `/account/*` - User dashboard routes (Epic 5 - create protected route stubs)
- `/parts` - May need to alias or redirect to `/products` for consistency

**Rendering Strategy by Route:**
- Vehicle pages: ISR with 60s revalidation + Sanity webhooks
- Product pages: SSG with 300s ISR + Shopify webhooks
- Homepage: ISR with 60s revalidation
- User dashboard: SSR (auth-required)
- Search: Client-side filtering

**SEO Considerations:**
- Canonical URLs must include full domain: `https://shop.enthusiastauto.com`
- Breadcrumbs must use schema.org BreadcrumbList structured data
- Sitemap must include all static and dynamic routes
- Metadata hierarchy: layout defaults → page overrides
- Open Graph and Twitter Cards for social sharing

### Project Structure Notes

**Alignment with unified project structure:**
- Breadcrumbs component location: `components/shared/Breadcrumbs.tsx`
- Metadata utilities: `lib/utils/metadata.ts` (if needed for shared metadata logic)
- Sitemap generation: `app/sitemap.ts` (Next.js 15 convention)
- Redirects: `next.config.ts` redirects() function

**Detected conflicts or variances:**
- Existing `/search/[collection]` route from Phase 1 may conflict with new unified `/search`
  - Resolution: Keep Phase 1 search at `/search/[collection]`, create new unified search at `/search` (without collection param)
- Product pages use `/product/[handle]` but story mentions `/parts` URL structure
  - Resolution: Use existing `/product/[handle]` structure, optionally add `/parts` redirect to `/products` listing
