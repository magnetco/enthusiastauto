# Story 3.1: Sanity CMS Setup & Configuration

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Patterns and Constraints

**Sanity CMS Integration:**
- Use Sanity v3 with Next.js 15 App Router compatibility
- Disable CDN (`useCdn: false`) for main client - ISR handles caching at Next.js level
- Use `perspective: 'published'` to fetch only published documents
- Separate read-only and authenticated client instances
- Sanity Studio deployed separately from Next.js app

**ISR Strategy:**
- Next.js ISR with 60-second revalidation for vehicle pages
- Webhook-driven on-demand revalidation for real-time status updates
- Solution Architecture §2.2 SSR Strategy (ISR):line_number:129-209

**Security Best Practices:**
- Store API token securely (environment variables, never commit)
- Use separate datasets for staging/production environments
- Enable Vision plugin only in development
- Verify CORS origins to prevent unauthorized Studio access

**Project Structure:**
```
enthusiastauto-1/
├── sanity/                    # Sanity Studio (separate app)
│   ├── sanity.config.ts      # Studio configuration
│   ├── sanity.cli.ts         # CLI configuration
│   ├── schemas/              # Content schemas (Story 3.2)
│   └── package.json          # Studio dependencies
├── lib/sanity/               # Next.js Sanity integration
│   ├── client.ts             # Sanity client instances
│   ├── queries.ts            # GROQ queries (Story 3.3+)
│   └── config.ts             # Shared configuration
```

### Project Structure Notes

**File Locations:**
- Sanity Studio: Separate application in `sanity/` directory
- Sanity clients: `lib/sanity/client.ts` for Next.js integration
- Environment variables: `.env.local` (Next.js) and `sanity/.env` (Studio)
- Schemas: `sanity/schemas/` (Story 3.2 will add vehicle schema)

**Deployment Strategy:**
- Sanity Studio: Deploy to Sanity hosted service (https://enthusiast-auto.sanity.studio)
- Next.js app: Continue deploying to Vercel with Sanity env vars
- Separate deployments enable independent updates

## Dev Agent Record

### Context Reference

- [Story Context 3.1](story-context-3.3.1.xml) - Generated 2025-10-21

### Agent Model Used

- Claude Sonnet 4.5 (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)

### Debug Log References

**Architecture Decision: Embedded Studio vs. Separate Deployment**
- User ran CLI init which created embedded Studio at `/studio` route
- This is BETTER than separate deployment: single deployment target, shared auth, simpler infrastructure
- Documented this decision in story completion notes

**TypeScript Module Resolution Issue: structureTool**
- Encountered TypeScript error: `structureTool` not exported from `sanity/structure` despite being in `.d.ts` file
- Root cause: Package export configuration or TypeScript module resolution
- Solution: Used deprecated `deskTool` from `sanity/desk` with TODO to migrate
- Added TODO comment in sanity.config.ts to migrate when resolved

**Dual Client Pattern**
- Created read-only client with `useCdn: false` (ISR handles caching at Next.js level)
- Created authenticated client with API token for webhook mutations
- Both use `perspective: 'published'` to fetch only published documents

### Completion Notes List

**Implementation Summary:**
1. ✅ Installed Sanity v4.11.0, @sanity/client@7.12.0, next-sanity@11.5.6
2. ✅ Initialized Sanity project: ID `n2usssau`, dataset `production`
3. ✅ Created dual client pattern: read-only + authenticated
4. ✅ Configured environment variables with placeholders for tokens
5. ✅ Set up embedded Studio at `/studio` with Enthusiast Auto branding
6. ✅ Created CORS configuration guide at sanity/CORS_SETUP.md
7. ✅ TypeScript build validation passed (13/13 pages generated)

**User Action Required:**
- Generate Sanity API Token from: https://www.sanity.io/manage/personal/project/n2usssau
- Update `.env.local` with real `SANITY_API_TOKEN` and `SANITY_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- Configure CORS origins in Sanity dashboard (follow sanity/CORS_SETUP.md)
- Add environment variables to Vercel dashboard for production deployment

**Next Story (3.2):**
- Define Vehicle schema in `sanity/schemaTypes/`
- Vehicle schema will include: title, year, make, model, price, images, description, specs, status

### File List

**New Files Created:**
- `sanity.config.ts` - Sanity Studio configuration
- `sanity/env.ts` - Environment variable configuration
- `sanity/lib/client.ts` - Dual Sanity client instances (read-only + authenticated)
- `sanity/lib/image.ts` - Image URL builder utilities
- `sanity/lib/live.ts` - Live content API configuration
- `sanity/schemaTypes/index.ts` - Schema type definitions (empty, ready for Story 3.2)
- `sanity/structure.ts` - Studio desk structure configuration
- `sanity/CORS_SETUP.md` - CORS and security configuration guide

**Modified Files:**
- `.env.local` - Added Sanity environment variables (project ID, dataset, API version, token placeholders)
- `package.json` - Added Sanity dependencies (@sanity/client, next-sanity, sanity, @sanity/cli)
