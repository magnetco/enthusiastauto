# Story 1.4: Product Search Functionality

Status: Done

## Story

As a user looking for specific parts,
I want to search by product name, part number, or keywords,
so that I can quickly find what I need.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Search bar prominently placed in header or above product grid ‚úÖ **EXISTING**
2. Search executes on Enter key or search button click ‚úÖ **EXISTING**
3. Results display matching products based on title, description, SKU, tags ‚úÖ **EXISTING (Shopify API)**
4. Search works in combination with active filters **NEW - Client-side integration needed**
5. "No results" state with helpful suggestions (clear filters, browse categories) ‚úÖ **EXISTING (basic)**
6. Search term is preserved in URL for sharing ‚úÖ **EXISTING**
7. Minimum 2 characters required before search executes **NEW - Validation enhancement**

## Existing Implementation Review

**‚úÖ Already Built (Template):**

- Search bar in navbar: `components/layout/navbar/search.tsx`
- Form submits to `/search` route with `?q=` query parameter
- Server-side Shopify API search: `getProducts({ query })`
- Search results page: `app/search/page.tsx`
- Result count display: "Showing X results for 'query'"
- Basic "No results" message
- URL query parameter preservation
- `SearchProductsClient` wrapper integrating with FilterProvider

**‚ùå Missing Integration:**

- Search term NOT included in FilterContext state
- Client-side filters (vendor/category/fitment) don't persist when navigating from search
- No search term badge in FilterBadges component
- Search doesn't combine with active client-side filters

**üîß Enhancements Needed:**

- Minimum character validation (2+ chars)
- Clear button (X icon) when search has text
- Keyboard shortcut (Cmd/Ctrl+K) to focus search
- Better "no results" state with suggestions

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

**Existing Components (DO NOT rebuild):**

- `/components/layout/navbar/search.tsx` - Search input component (already exists)
- `/app/search/page.tsx` - Search results page (already exists, uses Shopify API)
- `/components/SearchProductsClient.tsx` - Client wrapper for results (already exists)
- `/lib/shopify/index.ts` - getProducts() with query parameter (already exists)

**Components to UPDATE:**

- `/contexts/FilterContext.tsx` - Add searchTerm state variable
- `/lib/types/filters.ts` - Add searchTerm: string to FilterState type
- `/lib/utils/filters.ts` - Update filterProducts() to include search matching
- `/components/FilterBadges.tsx` - Display search term badge
- `/components/layout/navbar/search.tsx` - Add enhancements (clear button, validation, keyboard shortcuts)

**Current Search Flow:**

```
User types ‚Üí Form submits ‚Üí Navigate to /search?q=term ‚Üí
Server fetches from Shopify ‚Üí SearchProductsClient wraps with FilterProvider ‚Üí
ProductGridWithFilters displays results
```

**NEW Client-Side Integration Flow:**

```
FilterContext loads ‚Üí Read ?q= from URL ‚Üí Set searchTerm state ‚Üí
filterProducts() runs ‚Üí Combine search with vendor/category/fitment filters ‚Üí
Display filtered results + search badge
```

**Search Matching Strategy (Client-Side):**

```typescript
// Add to filterProducts() in lib/utils/filters.ts
if (filters.searchTerm && filters.searchTerm.length >= 2) {
  const searchLower = filters.searchTerm.toLowerCase();
  filtered = filtered.filter((product) => {
    return (
      product.title.toLowerCase().includes(searchLower) ||
      product.description.toLowerCase().includes(searchLower) ||
      product.variants.some((v) => v.sku?.toLowerCase().includes(searchLower))
    );
  });
}
```

**Key Insight:**
The Shopify API search already works great server-side. Story 1.4 is about **client-side integration** so search + filters work together seamlessly. We're NOT replacing the Shopify search, just making it work with our FilterContext from Story 1.3.

### Project Structure Notes

**File Locations:**

- Existing search: `components/layout/navbar/search.tsx` (Form with Next.js action="/search")
- Filter context: `contexts/FilterContext.tsx` (from Story 1.3)
- Filter utilities: `lib/utils/filters.ts` (from Story 1.3)
- Filter badges: `components/FilterBadges.tsx` (from Story 1.3)
- Search results: `app/search/page.tsx` (server component using Shopify API)

**Dependencies:**

- All ShadCN components already installed (Story 1.3)
- Lucide React icons already installed (for X icon, Search icon)
- Next.js useRouter and useSearchParams: Built-in
- useDebouncedValue hook: Need to create or use library (optional)

**Integration Points:**

1. FilterContext: Add searchTerm to state alongside vendors/categories
2. URL management: Read ?q= parameter, sync with FilterContext
3. filterProducts(): Extend to include search matching logic
4. Search bar: Keep existing component, add enhancements (clear button, validation)
5. FilterBadges: Add search badge display logic

**Scope Reduction:**

- ‚ùå NOT building a new search bar (already exists)
- ‚ùå NOT building server-side search (Shopify API already handles this)
- ‚ùå NOT building search results page (already exists at /app/search/page.tsx)
- ‚úÖ YES - Integrating search with FilterContext
- ‚úÖ YES - Adding UX enhancements to existing search bar
- ‚úÖ YES - Making search + filters work together

- All changes integrate seamlessly with existing FilterContext from Story 1.3

### Completion Notes

**Completed:** 2025-10-15
**Definition of Done:** All acceptance criteria met, code reviewed, tests passing, deployed

### Completion Notes List

**2025-10-15 - Story 1.4 Implementation Complete**

All 7 tasks (33 subtasks) successfully implemented:

1. **FilterContext Integration (Task 1):** Added searchTerm to FilterState, implemented URL synchronization with ?q= parameter, extended filterProducts() with case-insensitive search matching across title and description fields. Search combines with existing filters using AND logic.

2. **Search Badge (Task 2):** Added search term badge to FilterBadges component with format "Search: [term]" and X removal button. Badge removal updates URL and clears search from FilterContext. "Clear All Filters" functionality extended to include search term.

3. **Search Bar Enhancements (Task 3):** Added 2-character minimum validation with inline error message, clear button (X icon) that appears when input has text, improved form submission handling with validation checks.

4. **Keyboard Shortcuts (Task 4):** Implemented Cmd/Ctrl+K to focus search bar (desktop only), added keyboard shortcut hint to placeholder text "Search... (‚åòK)", Escape key clears focus, mobile detection prevents shortcuts on small screens.

5. **Empty State Improvements (Task 5):** Created contextual EmptyState component with three message variants based on active filters, added "Clear search" and "Clear all filters" buttons, displays active filter count for context.

6. **Performance Optimization (Task 6):** Created useDebounce hook with 300ms delay, debounced search filtering prevents lag on large product sets, added subtle loading spinner during debounce period, proper cleanup in useEffect.

7. **Testing & Accessibility (Task 7):** All acceptance criteria met. Search works in combination with vendor/category/vehicle filters using AND logic. URL updates correctly. Validation enforces 2-character minimum. Keyboard shortcuts functional. ARIA labels present. Badge removal updates results immediately.

**Build Status:** TypeScript build passed with no errors.

**2025-10-15 - Story Revised After Template Review**

- **CRITICAL REVISION:** Discovered existing search functionality in template
- Existing: Search bar (navbar), Shopify API search, /search route, URL params, result count, SearchProductsClient wrapper
- Missing: Client-side integration with FilterContext from Story 1.3
- **Scope significantly reduced** from 49 subtasks to 33 subtasks
- Focus shifted from "building search" to "integrating search with filters"
- Task 1: Integrate searchTerm into FilterContext (7 subtasks) - CRITICAL
- Task 2: Display search badge in FilterBadges (4 subtasks)
- Task 3: Enhance search bar UX with validation, clear button (5 subtasks)
- Task 4: Add keyboard shortcuts Cmd/Ctrl+K (4 subtasks)
- Task 5: Improve "no results" empty state (5 subtasks)
- Task 6: Add debounce for performance (4 subtasks)
- Task 7: Testing and validation (10 subtasks)
- **Key insight:** Shopify API search works great server-side. We need client-side integration so search + vendor/category/fitment filters work together using the FilterContext infrastructure from Story 1.3.
- Removed: Building new search bar, search results page, Shopify integration (all already exist)
- Added: Clear focus on FilterContext integration and UX enhancements
- Status: Draft (needs review via story-ready workflow)

**2025-10-15 - Story Created (Original)**

- Initial draft of Story 1.4 (Product Search Functionality)
- 7 tasks with 49 subtasks defined
- Built on assumption of building from scratch (INCORRECT - template has search)
