# Story 3.5: Vehicle Status Management & Real-Time Updates

Status: Done

## Story

As a **content editor**,
I want to **update vehicle status (current/sold) instantly in Sanity Studio**,
so that **the website always reflects accurate inventory availability with minimal delay**.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **AC1: Status Field in Sanity Studio**
   - Editors can mark vehicles as "current" or "sold" via dropdown/radio in Sanity Studio
   - Status field is required and validated (cannot be empty)
   - Status change is saved immediately when document is published
   - Status history tracked in Sanity with timestamp and editor name (optional enhancement)
   - Default status for new vehicles is "current"

2. **AC2: Webhook Configuration**
   - Sanity webhook configured to trigger on vehicle document changes (create, update, delete)
   - Webhook URL: `https://shop.enthusiastauto.com/api/revalidate/vehicle/{slug.current}`
   - Webhook filter: `_type == "vehicle"` (only triggers for vehicle documents)
   - Webhook projection includes: slug.current, status, _id
   - Webhook secret configured for signature verification
   - Webhook triggers within 5 seconds of status change in Sanity

3. **AC3: Next.js Revalidation API Route**
   - API route created at `app/api/revalidate/vehicle/[slug]/route.ts`
   - POST handler verifies Sanity webhook signature using HMAC SHA-256
   - Handler revalidates affected pages: `/vehicles/[slug]`, `/vehicles`, `/` (homepage)
   - Returns JSON response: `{ revalidated: true, slug: "vehicle-slug" }`
   - Error handling for: invalid signature (401), missing slug (400), processing failure (500)
   - Logs revalidation events for monitoring and debugging

4. **AC4: Vehicle Listing Page Updates**
   - Listing page reflects status changes within 60 seconds (ISR revalidation)
   - Webhook revalidation triggers immediate update for critical status changes
   - Filter option to show/hide sold vehicles (default: show all)
   - "SOLD" badge displays on vehicle cards when status is "sold"
   - Sold vehicles optionally sorted to end of list (configurable)

5. **AC5: Vehicle Detail Page Updates**
   - Detail page shows "SOLD" overlay/badge when vehicle status is "sold"
   - Badge prominently placed near title using ShadCN Badge variant="destructive"
   - Contact/inquiry button hidden or disabled for sold vehicles
   - Schema.org offer availability set to "SoldOut" for sold vehicles
   - Page revalidates immediately when webhook triggers (on-demand ISR)

6. **AC6: Homepage Featured Vehicles**
   - Homepage vehicle sections exclude sold vehicles by default
   - If featured vehicle is sold, it's replaced with next current vehicle
   - Homepage revalidates when featured vehicle status changes
   - Featured vehicles query: `*[_type == "vehicle" && status == "current" && featured == true]`

7. **AC7: Editor Workflow Documentation**
   - Documentation created for editors: "How to Mark a Vehicle as Sold"
   - Step-by-step guide with screenshots in Sanity Studio
   - Training materials updated to include status management workflow
   - Help text added to status field in Sanity Studio schema
   - Troubleshooting guide for common issues (webhook failures, revalidation delays)

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Patterns and Constraints

**ISR Strategy (Solution Architecture §2.2):**
- Vehicle pages use ISR with 60-second revalidation baseline
- Webhook-driven on-demand revalidation provides near-instant updates for critical changes
- Fallback to time-based ISR if webhook fails ensures eventual consistency
- Multiple paths revalidated per webhook: detail, listing, homepage

**Webhook Security:**
- HMAC SHA-256 signature verification prevents unauthorized revalidation requests
- Webhook secret stored in environment variable (SANITY_WEBHOOK_SECRET)
- Invalid signatures return 401 Unauthorized response

**Sanity Integration (Solution Architecture §3.1):**
- Status field added to vehicle schema as required field
- GROQ queries updated to project status in all vehicle queries
- Webhook filter ensures only vehicle documents trigger revalidation

### Source Tree Components to Touch

**Files to Create:**
- `app/api/revalidate/vehicle/[slug]/route.ts` - Webhook revalidation API route
- `sanity/docs/how-to-mark-vehicle-sold.md` - Editor documentation

**Files to Modify:**
- `sanity/schemas/vehicle.ts` - Add status field with validation
- `lib/sanity/queries.ts` - Include status in all vehicle queries
- `app/vehicles/[slug]/page.tsx` - Add sold badge and disable contact button
- `components/vehicles/VehicleCard.tsx` - Add SOLD badge for listing page
- `components/shared/ContactInquiry.tsx` - Add disabled state prop
- `app/page.tsx` - Filter homepage featured vehicles by status

**Environment Variables:**
- `SANITY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` - Added to .env.local and Vercel

### Testing Standards Summary

**Unit Tests (Testing Strategy):**
- Test webhook signature verification logic
- Test revalidatePath calls with correct paths
- Mock Sanity webhook payloads for API route testing

**Integration Tests:**
- End-to-end webhook flow: Sanity → API route → revalidation
- Verify sold vehicle display across all pages
- Test ISR fallback behavior when webhook fails

**Manual Testing:**
- Change vehicle status in Sanity Studio
- Verify updates appear on site within expected timeframe
- Test webhook logs in Sanity dashboard for delivery success/failure

### Project Structure Notes

**Alignment with Unified Project Structure:**
- API routes follow Next.js 15 App Router conventions: `app/api/[feature]/route.ts`
- Webhook handler uses dynamic route parameters: `[slug]`
- Error responses follow REST conventions: 401, 400, 500 with descriptive messages

**No Conflicts Detected:**
- New API route doesn't conflict with existing routes
- Status field addition is backward compatible (existing vehicles default to "current")
