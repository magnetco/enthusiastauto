# Story 1.2: Vehicle Fitment Filter (Year-Make-Model)

Status: Done

## Story

As a BMW owner,
I want to filter products by my specific vehicle's year, make, and model,
so that I only see parts that are compatible with my BMW.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Vehicle selector interface with Year dropdown (e.g., 2008-2024)
2. Make is pre-set to "BMW" (can be hidden or displayed)
3. Model dropdown populated dynamically from available product tags (X3, X4, 335i, 1 Series M, etc.)
4. Filter applies immediately when selections are made
5. Selected vehicle is saved to localStorage (persists across sessions)
6. "Clear filters" option resets vehicle selection
7. Product count updates dynamically as filters are applied
8. Products without fitment tags are either hidden or marked as "universal fit"

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

**Component Structure:**

- `/components/VehicleSelector.tsx` - NEW: Main vehicle selector component with Model and Year dropdowns
- `/components/FitmentBadge.tsx` - NEW: Badge component for showing fitment compatibility on product cards
- `/lib/types/filters.ts` - UPDATE: Add VehicleSelection type to FilterState
- `/lib/utils/filters.ts` - UPDATE: Extend filterProducts() to include vehicle fitment matching
- `/lib/utils/vehicle.ts` - NEW: Vehicle fitment parsing utilities (parseFitmentTags, matchVehicle)
- `/contexts/FilterContext.tsx` - UPDATE: Add vehicle state and setVehicle/clearVehicle functions
- `/components/FilterPanel.tsx` - UPDATE: Add Vehicle Fitment section with VehicleSelector
- `/components/FilterBadges.tsx` - UPDATE: Display vehicle selection as active filter badge
- `/components/product/ProductCard.tsx` - UPDATE: Show FitmentBadge when vehicle is selected

**Vehicle Data Model:**

```typescript
type VehicleSelection = {
  model: string; // e.g., "X4", "X3", "335i", "1 Series M"
  year: number; // e.g., 2022, 2020, 2010
};

type ParsedFitmentTag = {
  make: string; // Always "BMW"
  model: string; // e.g., "X4", "335i", "1 Series M"
  trim: string; // e.g., "xDrive30i", "M40", "Base" (optional, can be ignored for filtering)
  year: number; // e.g., 2022, 2010
};

type FilterState = {
  vendors: string[];
  categories: string[];
  vehicle: VehicleSelection | null; // NEW
};
```

**Actual Shopify Product Tag Format (from distributor):**

- Format: `"BMW [Model] [Trim] [Year]"`
- Examples from screenshots:
  - `"BMW X4 xDrive30i 2022"`
  - `"BMW X3 M40i 2023"`
  - `"BMW 335i Base 2010"`
  - `"BMW 1 Series M Base 2011"`
- **Individual years:** Each year is a separate tag (a product fitting 2019-2022 has 4 tags)
- **Includes trim:** Trim information like "xDrive30i", "M40", "Base" is included but can be ignored for filtering
- Products without fitment tags are considered "universal fit"

**Fitment Tag Parsing:**

```typescript
function parseFitmentTag(tag: string): ParsedFitmentTag | null {
  // Regex to match "BMW [Model] [Trim] [Year]"
  const match = tag.match(/^BMW\s+(.+?)\s+([A-Za-z]+)\s+(\d{4})$/);
  if (!match) return null;

  return {
    make: "BMW",
    model: match[1], // "X4", "335i", "1 Series M"
    trim: match[2], // "xDrive30i", "M40", "Base"
    year: parseInt(match[3]), // 2022, 2010
  };
}
```

**Fitment Matching Logic:**

```typescript
function matchVehicle(
  product: ShopifyProduct,
  vehicle: VehicleSelection | null,
): "compatible" | "universal" | "incompatible" {
  if (!vehicle) return "universal"; // No vehicle selected, show all

  const fitmentTags = product.tags
    .map(parseFitmentTag)
    .filter((tag): tag is ParsedFitmentTag => tag !== null);

  if (fitmentTags.length === 0) return "universal"; // No fitment data, universal fit

  // Match on model and year (ignore trim)
  const isCompatible = fitmentTags.some(
    (tag) => tag.model === vehicle.model && tag.year === vehicle.year,
  );

  return isCompatible ? "compatible" : "incompatible";
}
```

**Data Flow:**

```
User selects Model (X4) and Year (2022) → FilterContext updates state → localStorage saves
→ filterProducts() runs → Matches "BMW X4 xDrive30i 2022" tags → ProductGrid re-renders with compatible products
→ FitmentBadge displays "✓ Fits Your X4" on product cards
→ FilterBadges shows "Vehicle: X4 2022"
```

**Model Dropdown Population:**

- **Dynamic extraction from product tags** (recommended):
  - Parse all product tags on page load
  - Extract unique model names (X3, X4, 335i, 1 Series M, etc.)
  - Populate dropdown with available models only
  - Sort alphabetically
- Models seen in screenshots: X3, X4, 335i, 1 Series M
- Additional models will appear as products are added

**Year Range:**

- Extract dynamically from product tags (e.g., 2008-2024)
- Or hardcode based on inventory: 2008-2024 (current year)

### Project Structure Notes

**File Locations:**

- Vehicle selector UI: `components/VehicleSelector.tsx` (new component)
- Fitment badge: `components/FitmentBadge.tsx` (new component)
- Vehicle utilities: `lib/utils/vehicle.ts` (new utility file)
- FilterContext already exists: `contexts/FilterContext.tsx` (update)
- FilterPanel already exists: `components/FilterPanel.tsx` (update to add Vehicle Fitment section)
- FilterBadges already exists: `components/FilterBadges.tsx` (update to show vehicle badge)

**Existing Patterns (from Story 1.3):**

- FilterContext with React Context API for global state
- SessionStorage persistence pattern (use localStorage instead for vehicle per AC#5)
- FilterPanel with ShadCN Accordion for collapsible sections
- FilterBadges with brand-blue badges and X removal buttons
- filterProducts() utility for client-side filtering with AND logic

**Dependencies to Verify:**

- ShadCN Select component: Install via `npx shadcn-ui@latest add select`
- All other ShadCN components already installed (Accordion, Checkbox, Badge)
- localStorage API (browser native, no dependency)

**Potential Conflicts:**

- Coordinate with Story 1.3 (Vendor & Category Filters) to ensure vehicle filter integrates seamlessly
- Ensure vehicle fitment tags don't overlap with category tags (Story 1.3 uses productType field for categories)
- Vehicle selection should be independent filter dimension (not mutually exclusive with vendor/category)

**Integration with Story 1.3:**

- Story 1.3 already built FilterContext, FilterPanel, FilterBadges, and filterProducts() utility
- Story 1.2 extends these components rather than replacing them
- Vehicle filter is added as third filter dimension alongside vendors and categories
- All filters combine with AND logic
