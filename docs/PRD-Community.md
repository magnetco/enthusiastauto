**Target Scale:** 1-2 epics, 5-15 stories

---

## Description, Context and Goals

### Description

The Community Feature transforms Enthusiast Auto from a traditional e-commerce platform into an engaged enthusiast community by creating a centralized social feed where site administrators can publish blog content inline with user-generated posts. Inspired by Cars & Bids Communities, this feature enables automotive enthusiasts to share experiences, ask questions, and engage with both peer content and official blog posts in a unified feed.

Blog content from the existing site (a small number of posts) will be manually migrated and reformatted as community posts with an "Official" or "Staff" badge, appearing in the feed alongside user contributions. Site administrators (not community moderators) retain exclusive control over pinning/featuring content to highlight important announcements or featured articles.

### Deployment Intent

**MVP for Early Users** - Launch the Community feature to a select group of engaged enthusiasts to validate community engagement patterns, content quality, and feature usage before full production rollout. This phased approach allows us to iterate on moderation needs, content discovery, and user experience based on real usage data.

### Context

Enthusiast Auto currently operates as a dual-content platform (vehicles from Sanity CMS + parts from Shopify) with strong e-commerce functionality but limited community engagement. While users can browse and purchase, there's no mechanism for enthusiasts to share knowledge, connect with peers, or engage with the brand beyond transactions. This creates missed opportunities for retention, organic content generation, and community-driven growth.

The automotive enthusiast market thrives on community interaction - enthusiasts want to share builds, ask technical questions, and connect with like-minded owners. Platforms like Cars & Bids have demonstrated that integrating community features directly into the marketplace experience (rather than fragmenting to separate forums) significantly increases engagement and platform stickiness.

### Goals

1. **Increase User Engagement** - Drive users to spend more time on the platform through community interaction, with target metrics including daily active users, session duration, and return visit frequency.

2. **Build Enthusiast Network** - Foster meaningful connections between BMW enthusiasts for knowledge sharing, technical advice, and community building, creating a self-sustaining ecosystem of engaged users.

3. **Enhance Brand Authority** - Position Enthusiast Auto as the definitive BMW enthusiast hub - not just a marketplace, but the primary destination for the BMW community, establishing thought leadership and brand loyalty.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**FR001: Community Feed Display** - Users can view a unified community feed showing posts from both community members and site administrators in chronological order, with sorting options (Popular, New, Top).

**FR002: Create Community Posts** - Authenticated users can create posts with a title, body text (rich text editor), optional images, and community/category selection.

**FR003: Admin Content Badge** - Posts created by site administrators display a prominent "Staff" or "Official" badge to distinguish official content from user-generated posts.

**FR004: Pin/Feature Posts** - Site administrators (with admin role) can pin posts to the top of the community feed or specific community pages, ensuring important announcements and featured content remain visible.

**FR005: Community Organization** - Content is organized into topic-based communities (e.g., "General Discussion", "E30", "E36", "M3", "Parts & Builds") allowing users to filter the feed by community or view all posts.

**FR006: Post Engagement** - Users can upvote posts and add comments/replies to foster discussion and surface quality content through community voting.

**FR007: User Profiles in Community** - Users have community profiles showing their post history, comment activity, and basic account information (username, avatar, join date).

**FR008: Post Management** - Users can edit and delete their own posts; site administrators can edit, delete, or moderate any post for content policy enforcement.

**FR009: Rich Media Support** - Posts support embedded images with proper aspect ratios and responsive display, matching the visual style of the Cars & Bids community feed.

**FR010: Search and Discovery** - Users can search posts by keywords, filter by community, and discover trending or popular content through sorting mechanisms.

**FR011: Notifications** - Users receive notifications when someone replies to their post or comments, when their post is featured/pinned, or when they receive upvotes (basic notification system for MVP).

**FR012: Blog Post Migration Support** - Admin interface allows manual creation of community posts from existing blog content with proper formatting, images, and "Official" badge, with option to set custom publish dates for historical accuracy.

### Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR001: Performance** - Community feed loads in under 2 seconds on initial page load, with pagination or infinite scroll handling 50+ posts. Post creation and comment submission complete in under 1 second with optimistic UI updates.

**NFR002: Content Moderation & Safety** - System must support basic spam prevention (rate limiting on post creation: max 5 posts per user per hour), profanity filtering, and admin moderation tools to maintain community quality during MVP phase.

**NFR003: Integration with Existing Auth** - Community feature leverages existing NextAuth.js authentication system (from Stories 5.1-5.3) with no separate login required. User roles (admin vs. regular user) determine permissions for pinning and moderation.

**NFR004: Mobile Responsiveness** - Community interface is fully responsive and optimized for mobile devices (320px - 2560px), with touch-friendly interactions matching existing Enthusiast Auto design system and ShadCN UI components.

**NFR005: SEO & Discoverability** - Community posts are indexable by search engines with proper meta tags, Open Graph support for social sharing, and clean URLs (e.g., `/community/[slug]` or `/community/posts/[id]`) to drive organic traffic and enhance brand authority.

## User Journeys

### Primary Journey: Enthusiast Discovers and Engages with Community

**Persona:** Alex, a BMW E30 owner who regularly browses Enthusiast Auto for parts and restoration tips.

**Journey:**

1. **Discovery** - Alex visits Enthusiast Auto to browse E30 parts and notices a new "Community" link in the main navigation header.

2. **Exploration** - Alex clicks through to `/community` and sees a mixed feed of posts: a pinned official blog post about "Top 10 E30 Upgrades for 2025" (with Staff badge), user posts asking technical questions, build showcase posts with photos, and general discussion threads.

3. **Filtering** - Alex clicks the "E30" community filter in the left sidebar to focus on E30-specific content, seeing more relevant posts from fellow E30 owners.

4. **Engagement** - Alex reads a post titled "M20 timing belt replacement tips?" and upvotes it. He scrolls through the 8 comments and upvotes a particularly helpful reply about special tools needed.

5. **Contribution** - Inspired by the community, Alex clicks "+ New Post" and creates his first post titled "Just finished my E30 suspension refresh - AMA" with before/after photos, selecting the "E30" community category.

6. **Validation** - Within hours, Alex receives notifications that 3 users have upvoted his post and 2 people commented asking questions. He returns to reply to the comments, fostering discussion.

7. **Return Visit** - The next day, Alex bookmarks `/community` and makes it part of his daily routine, checking for new posts, replies to his content, and opportunities to help other enthusiasts.

**Outcome:** Alex transitions from passive consumer to active community member, increasing his engagement with the platform and brand loyalty to Enthusiast Auto.

## UX Design Principles

1. **Seamless Integration** - Community features blend naturally into the existing Enthusiast Auto experience. Navigation, visual design, and interaction patterns match the established ShadCN UI design system. Users shouldn't feel like they've left the main platform when entering the community.

2. **Low Barrier to Participation** - Minimize friction for first-time contributors. Post creation uses familiar patterns (similar to form flows from vehicle contact forms in Story 3.7). Clear CTAs like "+ New Post" and simple rich text editors encourage participation without intimidation.

3. **Trust & Authority Signals** - Visual indicators clearly distinguish official content from user posts. "Staff" badges, pinned post styling, and thoughtful typography hierarchy establish credibility and help users quickly identify authoritative information.

4. **Content Discovery First** - Feed design prioritizes content discovery through effective sorting (Popular, New, Top), community filtering, and visual hierarchy. Post cards show engaging thumbnails, clear titles, engagement metrics (upvotes, comment counts), and community tags at a glance.

5. **Mobile-Optimized Interaction** - Given automotive enthusiasts often browse from garages or on-the-go, mobile experience is paramount. Touch targets meet 44x44px minimum, infinite scroll or pagination works smoothly on mobile, and post creation/commenting flows are optimized for mobile keyboards and one-handed use.

## Out of Scope

The following features are intentionally excluded from the MVP to maintain focus on core community engagement. These may be considered for future phases based on user feedback and adoption metrics:

### Deferred Features

**Advanced Moderation:**
- Community moderators (non-admin users with limited mod powers)
- Automated spam detection using ML/AI
- Content filtering rules and blacklists
- User reputation scoring system
- Shadowban or timeout capabilities

**Enhanced Engagement:**
- Post reactions beyond upvotes (emoji reactions, awards)
- User badges and achievements for community contributions
- Leaderboards showing top contributors
- Private messaging between users
- User following/follower relationships

**Content Features:**
- Video uploads and embedding (beyond images)
- Polls and surveys in posts
- Post scheduling for admins
- Draft posts and autosave
- Post templates for common discussion types

**Discovery & Organization:**
- Advanced search filters (date range, author, upvote threshold)
- Saved posts/bookmarks for later reading
- Tags/labels beyond community categorization
- Related posts recommendations
- Trending topics algorithm

**Notifications:**
- Email digests (daily/weekly community highlights)
- Push notifications (mobile/desktop)
- Granular notification preferences per community
- @mentions in posts/comments

**Analytics & Insights:**

- Post performance metrics for admins
- Community health scoring
- Content insights and trending analysis

**Integration:**
- Link community posts to specific vehicles or parts (deep integration with marketplace)
- Share garage items in community posts
- Post from vehicle/product detail pages

### Rationale

These features are excluded to:
1. **Validate core hypothesis** - Test if community engagement drives retention before building advanced features
2. **Minimize MVP complexity** - Launch faster with focused feature set
3. **Learn from users** - Let early user behavior guide which advanced features to prioritize
4. **Reduce technical risk** - Avoid complex features like ML spam detection, real-time systems, or deep marketplace integration until foundation is proven
