- Total Points: 212

**After Community:**
- Total Stories: 49
- Total Points: 290
- **New:** Epic 9 (8 stories, 44 pts) + Epic 10 (7 stories, 34 pts)

- **Phase 3:** Epic 8 (Events) + Epic 9-10 (Community)

---

## üîó Dependencies

**Community (Epics 9-10) depends on:**
- ‚úÖ Epic 5: User Management (COMPLETE) - Auth system, User model
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Epic 6: Search (3/4 stories complete) - Fuse.js infrastructure
- ‚úÖ Existing infrastructure: ShadCN UI, Vercel Blob, Navigation

**Blocks nothing** - Can be implemented anytime after Epic 5 complete

---

## üìÅ Generated Documents

1. `docs/solution-architecture-community.md` - Complete architecture (100% ready)
2. `docs/PRD-Community.md` - Product requirements (already exists)
3. `docs/epic-stories-community.md` - Story breakdown (already exists)
4. `docs/HANDOFF-Community-Solutioning.md` - Handoff notes (already exists)
5. `docs/community-integration-summary.md` - This document

---

## ‚ö° Quick Start (When Ready to Implement)

**Option 1: Start Community Now (Recommended after Phase 2)**
```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install @tiptap/react@^2.1.0 @tiptap/starter-kit@^2.1.0 @tiptap/extension-link@^2.1.0
npm install bad-words@^3.0.4 isomorphic-dompurify@^2.11.0
npm install --save-dev @types/bad-words

# 2. Update Prisma schema (add 5 community tables)
# 3. Run migration
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_community_tables

# 4. Begin Story 9.1 via create-story workflow
```

**Option 2: Complete Phase 2 First**
- Finish Story 3.7 (Vehicle Contact Form)
- Complete remaining Epic 6 stories
- Complete Epic 8 (Events - 3 stories)
- Then start Community (Epics 9-10)

---

## üéØ Recommended Approach

**Mike's Decision:** Based on your existing 18 stories complete (180 points) and current momentum:

**Recommended:** Complete Phase 2 (current epic queue) FIRST, then tackle Community as Phase 3

**Reasoning:**
1. Don't context-switch mid-phase (Story 3.7 is ready to go)
2. Complete Epic 6 for full search infrastructure (benefits Community)
3. Epic 8 (Events) is small (3 stories) - knock it out
4. Community is substantial (15 stories) - deserves focused attention

**Timeline:**
- **Now - Week 2:** Finish Phase 2 (Stories 3.7, 6.4, 8.1-8.3)
- **Week 3-6:** Epic 9 Core Community (8 stories, 4 weeks)
- **Week 7-9:** Epic 10 Admin Tools (7 stories, 3 weeks)

## ‚úÖ Status

- [x] Solution architecture complete
- [x] Cohesion check passed (98%)
- [x] Integration patterns defined
- [x] Dependencies validated
- [ ] Workflow status updated (manual step)
- [ ] Main PRD updated (optional)
- [ ] Ready for implementation

**Next Action:** Update `docs/bmm-workflow-status.md` to add Epics 9-10 to BACKLOG, or proceed with current Story 3.7 and defer Community until Phase 3.

---

**Decision Point:** Would you like to:
1. **Update workflow status now** and add Community to backlog
2. **Defer Community** to Phase 3 (after finishing Phase 2)
3. **Start Community immediately** (context-switch from current work)

Recommendation: **Option 2** (Defer to Phase 3)
