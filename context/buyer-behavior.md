## Key Takeaways

1. **Not all visitors are buyers** — Most are browsing, learning, or dreaming. Serve them appropriately.

2. **Intent evolves gradually** — Nurture relationships over months, not days. Play the long game.

3. **Behavioral signals matter more than demographics** — How someone acts tells you more than who they are.

4. **Personalization drives conversion** — Adaptive UX based on behavior significantly improves outcomes.

5. **Trust is fragile** — Aggressive tactics can push someone back to earlier stages or away entirely.

6. **Education builds authority** — Position EAG as the expert, not just a seller.

7. **Timing is everything** — The right message at the wrong time is the wrong message.

8. **Loyal customers are gold** — LTV of repeat customers far exceeds acquisition costs.

9. **Measure and optimize** — Track stage progression and optimize conversion at each transition.

10. **Authenticity wins** — Enthusiasts can smell BS. Be genuine, transparent, and passionate.
