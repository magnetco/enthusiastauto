# Install Notion Sync - Validation Checklist

This checklist validates that the Notion integration setup completed successfully.

## Configuration File Validation

- [ ] Config file exists at `bmad/notion-sync/config.yaml`
- [ ] Config contains valid `notion_api_token` (starts with 'secret_')
- [ ] Config contains `notion_database_id` (32-character alphanumeric)
- [ ] Config contains `current_status_block_id` (32-character alphanumeric or empty if skipped)
- [ ] Config contains `project_name` (non-empty string)
- [ ] Config includes `status_mapping` object with at least 5 status types
- [ ] All path variables use proper {project-root} syntax

## API Authentication Validation

- [ ] Notion API token successfully authenticates (test call to /v1/users/me returns 200)
- [ ] Integration has access to at least one database
- [ ] Selected database ID matches an accessible database in Notion workspace

## Database Access Validation

- [ ] Can query the configured database (GET /v1/databases/{database_id} returns 200)
- [ ] Database has required properties: Story Name (title), Status (select)
- [ ] Integration has read and write permissions to the database

## Status Block Validation (if configured)

- [ ] Can read the status block (GET /v1/blocks/{block_id} returns 200) OR status block was skipped
- [ ] Integration has permissions to update the block OR status block was skipped
- [ ] Block is in a page that's shared with the integration OR status block was skipped

## Data Directory Validation

- [ ] Data directory exists at `bmad/notion-sync/data/`
- [ ] Data directory is writable
- [ ] Changelog file exists at `bmad/notion-sync/data/changelog.md`
- [ ] Changelog file contains initial header and timestamp
- [ ] Changelog file is writable for future updates

## Security Validation

- [ ] Config file is NOT in version control (should be in .gitignore)
- [ ] API token is stored securely (not exposed in logs or output)
- [ ] Token display in confirmation screens shows only last 4 characters

## Integration Permissions

- [ ] Notion integration is properly configured at notion.so/my-integrations
- [ ] Integration has been shared with the target database (via database settings â†’ Connections)
- [ ] Integration has been shared with the status block's parent page (if status block configured)

## Workflow Completion

- [ ] All 12 setup steps completed without errors
- [ ] User received success confirmation message
- [ ] User was provided with next steps (load Status Reporter Agent, try first update)
- [ ] Configuration saved before workflow exit

## Error Recovery

- [ ] If setup failed, error message was clear and actionable
- [ ] If API calls failed, appropriate troubleshooting guidance was provided
- [ ] User can restart setup without conflicts (existing config can be overwritten)

## Post-Setup Validation Commands

After setup completes, test these commands work:

- [ ] `*test-connection` from Setup Agent successfully validates all settings
- [ ] `*show-config` from Setup Agent displays configuration (with masked token)
- [ ] Status Reporter Agent can be loaded without errors
- [ ] Config variables are accessible to the Status Reporter Agent

---

## Success Criteria

Setup is considered successful when:

1. âœ… Config file exists with all required fields
2. âœ… API authentication works (test call succeeds)
3. âœ… Database is accessible and has required properties
4. âœ… Status block is accessible (or intentionally skipped)
5. âœ… Data directory and changelog are initialized
6. âœ… User received confirmation and next steps

## Troubleshooting Reference

If validation fails, common issues:

**Token Authentication Fails:**
- Verify token copied correctly from notion.so/my-integrations
- Check token hasn't expired or been revoked
- Ensure token starts with 'secret_'

**Database Not Accessible:**
- Confirm database is shared with integration (Database â†’ ... â†’ Connections)
- Verify integration is enabled in Notion workspace settings
- Check database hasn't been archived or deleted

**Status Block Not Accessible:**
- Confirm parent page is shared with integration (Page â†’ Share â†’ Connections)
- Verify block ID is correct (should be 32 characters)
- Ensure block wasn't deleted

**Config File Issues:**
- Check write permissions on bmad/notion-sync/ directory
- Verify YAML syntax is valid (no unescaped quotes)
- Ensure file encoding is UTF-8

**Validation Complete**: All systems nominal if all checkboxes are ticked! ðŸš€
